INSERT INTO `review` VALUES (3,'B002ED84H2','This phone is a bit small and slippery for us clumsy guys, but that is it\'s only gig, well, and a small keypad. I am not a smart phone kind of a guy, and I know that eventually that will be all that is offered, but until then I will go kicking and screaming into that goodnight, and this phone will be my combat buddy. Anyway, it has an MP3 player that is better than any player I have ever owned, and the radio picks up stations quite well, even inside (Sony Walkman eat your heart out). The beauty of the MP3 side of this phone is that you can get any size memory card for it, and the earbuds that come with it are very durable with a good sound.'),(4,'B002ED84H2','Eerything about this phone is great except for the speakerphone.. I could hear fine, but people complained that it was hard to hear me clearly when I used the speakerphone-- something that\'s important to me, since I prefer not to have all those cancer-causing microwaves right next to my head that many hours! (Holding a celphone to my ear consistantly makes my ears ring anyways).DON\'T get this phone if the speakerphone is an important feature to you. I suggest the Nokia 5310 Music Xpress. It\'s thinner and sleaker, with much better speakerphone.'),(5,'B002ED84H2','Probably one of Nokia\'s underrated phones. It\'s not exactly a smart phone, but then it can give the more expensive ones their run for the money. I had this phone for 2 years; probably would have and still use it now if I haven\'t lost it, but that\'s another story. This is one tight phone to have, and you\'ll just keep on loving it. Great as well for listening to music. One website actually reviewed it and says the sound quality is so much better than an iPod, which is a compliment for this phone. TFT screen though would wash out if you\'re using this under the sun, but then again how many people you know actually use their cellphones outside on broad daylight? Overall this phone is one you\'ll keep for years, and if I do find one that is brand new I\'d buy it at once.'),(6,'B0036DDT6U','Hello everyone. First thing I will say is that the phone itself looks great.The Nokia packaging is not that good, but it does its job well and the phone arrived in excelente shape and with all the announced accessories (I actually expected a nicer packaging, but that is just me I guess).I bought this to replace a Samsung Ommia I900, and before that I had the Nokia 5800 and the fist improvement I noticed in the X6, as it has great response, eventhough it takes a bit to get used to since it is capacitive (Mainly you need to use your finger tips, and not a stylus or \"nails\"). It is also a lot faster than the 5800, applications load better, keyboards display better (Nicer screen resolution as well I think) and overall it is easier to handle.The music sound is very nice, and it has 16GB of memory. Would have still liked if it had a Micro SD slot, as some other reviewers have said, even though 16GB is preety much space for regular music and photos.The camera is nicer than the one on the 5800, but lacks some of the functions that the Omnia I900 had like face recognition, smile shutter, etc.Overall, I would deffinitely recommend this smartphone on its price range (Around $300 USD now, I bought it for $50 more), great quality (Nokia has never dissapointed in phone quality, or phone call quality), quadband, works with 3G network (At least here in Colombia), GPS (You can also make the GPS work as a standard service withouth data plans, with some programs like Garmin and some small settings), camera, etc.'),(7,'B0036DDT6U','i have had this phone for 8 months now, I used to have a nokia n95 and decided to upgrade. i really like this phone because it has pretty much the same functions as the n95 but is way smaller and has the touchscreen. the pictures really good and the video too. the only thing that i dont like is that even that i\'ve had for a long time, i still cant get used to the qwerty keyboard when you turn the phone, sometimes it really is a pain in the butt. i wish that for the next phone, nokia can change the OS; i guess that symbian is good, but the problem is that almost every app that you whant to add is gona cost you something, unlike android that is way easier to find suitable apps. also, i think that is a bit overpriced if you actually compare it to other phones in the same price-range. dont get me wrong, i like this phone, i guess that every phone has its flaws.'),(8,'B0036DDT6U','Having owned a Nokia N85, I thought this would be a step up. Having seen the product for $200, I decided to buy one. I got it a week later (blame Dell). And I requested a return 6 hours later. And I came this close to throwing it across the room.For starters, the user interface is terrible. The web browser uses on-screen menus, due to the touch interface. Which is fine, but when the viewing is switched from portrait to landscape, the on-screen buttons get twice as large, and obscure more of the content. After a few seconds, the on screen buttons go away, but it also resizes the width of the viewing window with it, shifting the text and making it very easy to lose your place when you are trying to read something. And there is no way, that I\'ve found, to force the on screen menu to disappear. You just have to wait. To zoom into something, you have to bring up the on-screen menu, tap the \"zoom\" function, and then, with your fingers, manually adjust the slider. This is very annoying. To alleviate, I downloaded Opera Mobile, whose on-screen keyboard on this device is so small, it\'s just as aggravating.In most of the menus, you can swipe vertically to scroll down, but you cannot swipe horizontally to switch between tabs. However, in some windows you can. Sometimes you can single-tap an option, sometimes you have to double-tap. Utterly annoying.The typing is wretched, too. In portrait mode, you use an on-screen number pad like you would with a traditional phone, which would be fine, except this 2009 model does not come with T9. No predictive text in landscape mode either, and the software keyboard is a bit cramped and doesn\'t come with niceties like a \".com\" button to finish URLs with. There is also no way to cancel out of text input, the best you can do is delete everything you\'ve written and hit the green check mark. Again, it\'s almost as if no one cared to use this device in the real world.I have also come across many bugs in the software (running the latest version as of June 2010), where the menus just don\'t work, or options don\'t pop up the way they should. In the few hours or so I\'ve had to play with the device, I\'ve had to restart the device no less than 4 times just to get it working properly.The build quality is suspect. The battery cover is made of flimsy plastic and you basically have to pry it off to open it. The front face feels like it\'s made of plastic as well and doesn\'t seem like it can stand up to being in your pockets.Other major annoyances: it comes with a USB port and a proprietary port for power. It does not charge through the USB port at all. It also uses a proprietary Nokia 3.5mm jack for voice communications. Normal earbuds will work fine, but these $150 Bose earbuds with a microphone will not work.The speakers are quite good. However, the media player is terrible. If you play \"All Songs\" the device can\'t distinguish between ringtones and actual music on the device, so prepare to hear some of those during a shuffle session at the gym. There are no codecs to play many popular file formats.I can go on and on about how terrible this device is, but I hope I\'ve already convinced you to not buy this product. It\'s amazing how Nokia can keep up with this type of technological and UI  obstinance while companies like google, apple and even microsoft are coming up with new ways to make a phone work better. This phone feels like no one cared about it from beginning to end. It is an overall poor product.'),(9,'B0036DDT6U','I purchased this phone for my boyfriend and he loved this phone! He had no problems with this phone. Everything worked great. However, after only having the phone for 2 weeks, one day while we were shopping, he went into the restroom at the store and forgot his phone in the restroom. 15 minutes later when he remembered and went to look for it, it was gone and it was never returned. I purchased the LG GC900 for him and although it is a good phone, he is unable to connect to the internet not even WIFI and he is unable to send or receive MMS. So, now he he wants to purchase the Nokia X6 again. We absolutely love the Nokia phones and have never had any problems with these phones. Will definately purchase this phone again and I also plan to purchase the Nokia N8!'),(10,'B003V4AJSU','My old flip phone was behaving strangely, so I needed an upgrade.  But I was not looking to sign up for a new two year contract with AT&T.  I am retired and stay at home most of the time...the cell phone is not used that much...as a matter of fact, I have 5000 unused rollover minutes at the present.  I would not make much use of a smartphone, and I certainly didn\'t want the extra cost that AT&T charges for the their data and messaging plans.  But I did want to be able to send text messages to the kids if necessary and the old phone did not have a qwerty keyboard and as an old man, I couldn\'t negotiate the old style keyboard very well.  So I was looking for an unlocked Phone that would work on the AT&T network and that had a qwerty keyboard.  The Nokia C3 fit my needs perfectly.  And so far, it seems to be of excellent quality...I have always had good results with Nokia and this one is no exception.  The voice quality is great. I did have to go through a learning process, but I have almost mastered the basic needs that I have.  I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for something short of a smartphone.'),(11,'B003V4AJSU','I bought this phone through the Amazon Marketplace site and the seller was Everydaycell well the first day I used the phone the screen blanked out about 9 times totally blank screen. I also could\'nt send out multimedia messages and Nokia customer service told  me you have to have the phone configured by your mobile provider. I emailed Everydaycell to let them know about the problem and several days passed by no answer. I called Amazon customer service and she guided me through the procedure I had to go through in order to get a refund. This was my first time ordering from the Amazon site and I feel horribly disapointed with the hassle I had to go through. I sent the phone back to Everydaycell and  a note included expecting a full refund of my money. They claim they charge a 20% fee for opened products how is that possible if the only way you can test your product is by opening the package and testing it out. So now I sit and wait to see if they refund the full. If they dont B.B.B. will be receiving a complaint from me from this company. Dont buy this phone and dont buy from Everydaycell!'),(12,'B003V4AJSU','Okay this is overall a good phone. So far it seems to do everything I need it to do, and I only paid about $80 for it.However, I am starting to discover little things that bother me. First, there is no external volume button. You have to press a few buttons to get to the menu to change the ring volume.Second, there is not a brightness control. If you are in a bar (which I am in a lot) your face will light up because of the bright screen. I end up holding the phone at an angle to avoid embarassment. Also the screen will go black after 8 seconds and there is no way to change this power saving feature.When you are composing a text message, there is no quick way to save it to send later.I would exchange the phone for another but I think it is too late (I bought it at a local store in Mexico). So I will keep it until it breaks. It just annoys me that these little features have been excluded so that you will want to buy another phone (Nokia hopes you will upgrade I imagine). Kindof like how windows always has things wrong with it so that you need the next version.'),(13,'B003V4AJSU','If you are like me, a college student with not much $$ lying around, then this phone is great for you! It looks a bit like a blackberry from far (hence the style), the QWERTY keyboard is especially useful for text messaging (extremely useful especially during a ahem. *crisis*) and everything that you need is there!The downside- it can\'t read PDF files, can\'t play ANGRYBIRDS (Hey beggars aren\'t choosers) and most games, so if you\'re a major cell phone gamer- go spend more money to get something better, otherwise, for people who just needs a stylish phone to socialize, this phone is more than enough for you!'),(14,'B003V4AJSU','I have had one of these exact phones for over 2 years and I\'m very happy with it. My wife wanted a new phone to replace her old Motorola flip phone, and I asked her if she\'d like to get one like mine. I use Consumer Cellular as my provider, and bought mine from them originally, but they no longer offer this phone, the Nokia C3-00. I tried buying her a Samsung smartphone, but it sucked the battery down in less than 2 days even with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Maps, etc. and other power hungry functions turned off. Also the Smartphone for some reason started using up my very limited data allowance I have with Consumer Cellular. I saw the Nokia C3-00 offered by Amazon as a brand new, unlocked phone for 110 bucks, so I jumped on it. When it arrived, I charged up the battery, put the SIM card in from my wife\'s other phone, and there it was. The greatest things about this phone are its simplicity and battery life. After charging my own C3-00, I usually get 8 days out of it with moderate use before the battery indicator goes from 4 bars to 3 bars, but I charge it again at 3 bars. The voice clarity is great too. Texting is fairly easy as it does have a QWERTY keyboard with alpha numeric and symbols. We are not big &#34;texters&#34; by any means, and I\'m not sure if a &#34;power texter&#34; would like this, but maybe they would. It gets the job done. I did check the warranty status of the phone on Nokia\'s website, and the serial number came up as &#34;out of US warranty&#34;, but emails back and forth from Amazon customer service says that my Amazon invoice as buying this as a new phone here in the US would cover it as being under warranty. I hope to never have to find out. The phone is brand new; it\'s just that these phones were produced and sold mainly in 2010 and 2011 I think. I guess this is what they may call &#34;old new stock&#34;?The firmware version of mine and my wife\'s phone is 3.65, and Nokia\'s OVI software suite when connected to the phone, says there is no newer version available for the phone. One more thing: both our phones have no obvious Wi-Fi connection choice under &#34;Settings/Connectivity&#34; menus. Love the phone anyway for the pluses I mentioned, and for me, there really are no negatives at all. It has all the features mentioned in Amazon\'s specs, but for email, I really do not remember seeing a &#34;dedicated email&#34; key, but email is doable under messages where you write a message, and then chose &#34;mail&#34; instead of &#34;number for the intended recipient. It may have been there before I customized the display layout and shortcut key assignments: yes, just checked it, and it is assignable as a shortcut to one of the keys.'),(15,'B003V4AJSU','The phone is light and has great battery life. The screen is clean and easy to read and the buttons are great if you text a lot (not like the Samsung phone I replaced with this one.) The camera is as expected, just a novelty, don\'t expect to get good pics, just mediocre. I like the phone ok, no real issues. The thing is that I don\'t think, for me, it is worth the price. I would rather pay a little more and have more functionality. This phone is pretty basic and the price is not bad, but again, I am going to apply my refund to something with more features, like touch screen and a larger screen. Really, I\'d like something I can download apps AND have the great functionality of a Nokia, so gonna search for something that fits my need and my budget, but for me, this phone wasn\'t it.'),(16,'B003V4AJSU','The C3-00 is durable, fits comfortably in my jeans pocket, and has a screen that is clear and readable even in bright sunlight.  The interface is easy to learn - I never had to touch the manual.  It is comfortable to hold while texting.  I didn\'t realize how wonderful a QWERTY keyboard would be until I had one.  Now I\'ll never buy a phone without!  It is easy to use the WiFi to browse the web and download content without paying for a data plan.  The layout of the main menu screen is easy to customize with exactly the information you want to see at a glance.  The sound is great and this phone has completely replaced my iPod.'),(17,'B003V4AJSU','I bought this phone while in the Philippines, for like $100.00 US dollars. I love the wifi, and being able to change out the sim card for whatever country I am in while in asia, and even better now that i am back in the states I have upgraded the phones sophware and now have some added apps, and have a pay as u go service plan for 50 dollars a month unlimited txt and call, and web, works even better with the 3G, just love this darn thing, am not on the pc as much now as can do it all through the phone, ok well I still have my pc, gotta play crysis and fsx.'),(18,'B003V4AJSU','It\'s #1 feature in my opinion is battery life.  I have left the phone on with bluetooth connectivity on and it has been 5 1/2 days on one charge with light phone and internet, I am down to one green bar on the battery but the thing still hasn\'t given me a low battery warning.  Battery life is awesome.I use t-mobile and since I have wifi at home and work I don\'t need a data plan.  I do have the $1.99 per MB of data service on my plan and if you have that then the phone will use tiny amounts of data to give you email alerts.  After 5 days of being always on it has used 0.2 MB so I am looking at $2 or $4 a month for email alerts.The operating system is very primitive but the calendar (that syncs with outlook, but a USB cable is required, no wifi sync) and email (I use multiple accounts with gmail no problem) are both good.  I got an 8 gb memory card so I could use it as an mp3 player.  The thing in the middle looks like a track pad in the picture but it\'s just an up/down/left/right switch.  There is no gps and really no useful apps to download for it.  It does let you check facebook alerts easily if you are in to that but I used the space to always display the current date.If you want a phone with incredibly awesome battery life that lets you check your email, carry your schedule, and doesn\'t lock you in to an expensive plan for two years then this is the phone to get.'),(19,'B003V4AJSU','When you first pick up the Nokia C3, you can think that you have a modern looking full QWERTY Blackberry. It is a cool looking phone, with a very easy to use keyboard.Its light weight, so it dosent feel heavy in your pocked, has great battery life. The sound clarity is good, as is the camera. Its not a high end camera phone, but its pictures are just as clear as my old 8900.It dosent compare with the high end smart phones like the new Blackberries or HTC androids, but for the $160 range that its in, it certainly gives you that expensive look, and is a great email/messaging device.'),(20,'B003V4AJSU','I have three of these, and they are great phones.I bought another, and did not get what is advertised.  Most other buyers don\'t, either.  The phone listed is a \'US Version with Warranty.\'  Many (most/all?) of what is being shipped are not US phones.  The problem with that is that Nokia\'s one year limited US warranty applies only to US phones.  You may not know this until you try to get warranty repair service, as other reviewers here have noted.  But a call to Nokia with the IEMI number will tell whether you have a US phone or not.Amazon is aware that shipped phones routinely don\'t match the description, and won\'t do anything about it.  So do your homework and don\'t be deceived.  If a factory warranty is important to you, this is an unreliable source.'),(21,'B003V4AJSU','I bought the Nokia C-3 because I needed something better than the .6 MP camera on the X2. At first, I loved the C-3 for everyday use, browsing, and taking pictures.First, the speaker imploded and started struggling to play music or ringtones through the distortion. That was tolerable, I suppose.Secondly, and this did the phone in, the casing began to peel off. At first, I thought maybe it was just plastic from when I bought it that was peeling off. But then it started cracking and the paint chipping.Nokia seems to be giving up, at this point. What used to be a manufacturer of reliable, inexpensive phones now makes expensive, unreliable phones. The C-3 and N8 have both been nightmares for me. I have spent over $1000 on Nokia phones that are now useless.'),(22,'B003V4AJSU','I really like the phone, looks great, sound is great, quick learning curve, but the battery life sucks. I put it on the charger before bed and it doesn\'t even completely charge after 6 hours of non-use. Then the battery is almost dead after a couple of hours of non-use off the charger. Not sure if it\'s just a bad battery from the supplier or the design of the phone itself.Not sure why the first time I sent a review in it said \'A kids review\' I\'m 48 years old!** Update Feb 19,2011 **The battery that came with the phone continued to get worst, to the point that if I wanted to make a call that would last 10 mins or so, I would have to plug it in and use it as a corded phone. I picked up a battery at battery+ and the new battery works well, but added another $35 dollars to the cost of the phone.'),(23,'B003V4AJSU','I got one of these phones in Europe to use mainly over there on a pay as you go plan. All 4 bands, 2 MP camera, nice keyboard and color screen, unlocked. It\'s pretty and inexpensive. Bingo, I thought, I can use it in the US as well for SMS, and I can use it for simple internet tasks over WiFi! Dream on, dreamer! You know the expression \"too good to be true\"?The problems are HUGE.1) The design of the interface is miserable. It\'s even hard to explain. Tasks are accessed from a menu that is programmable. There is an icon menu too, and it\'s programmable. But where is the full list of tasks to pull into these menus? That\'s so buried I can only find it by chance now and then. Everything is counter-intuitive. In the end it\'s more like a Rubik\'s Cube than anything. I\'ve spent hours trying to set it up. Good Luck. You will also discover its countless ways to unexpectedly go into data mode. See item 2.2) The selection of data modes does not allow you to turn off cellular data completely in favor of WiFi. You never know when it\'s going to go into roaming cellular data mode. It\'s like a diabolical billing trap. Sitting on a strong WiFi connection I\'ve managed to inadvertently consume all 25 Euros of credits repeatedly within an hour of trying to use the device solely over the selected WiFi. More than the phone itself cost. Assuming that there is any way to turn off billable internet, you will likely spend so much money on unintentional cellular connections trying to figure it out that it\'s immaterial. For instance, you want to change the color theme. Bam, it connects and finds big files to download. The video mode is terrible. The camera is bad. Why do they give you a 2 MP camera? So the phone can run up a bill \"synchronizing\" big files. Do stick to prepaid. I\'m glad I wasn\'t using it on a billable plan, or I\'d be looking at a bill in the hundreds if not thousands. The idea of putting an open-ended account\'s SIM card in it is suicidal. I\'m going to load it up again with 5 euros and I\'m never going to use it for anything stateside but SMSing, and as a basic phone when not roaming. The worst it can do then is deplete the 5 Euros.3) The Energy Saver feature requires hitting keys to keep it from turning off the screen. There seems to be no way to change the 9 second time-out. This alone makes it useless. Try reading the news or doing anything other than basic SMSing when the screen keeps turning off unless you keep hitting keys! It\'s designed to make you hit random keys in desperation, and mine came pre-programmed so that hitting the right key would connect to Plus! data services (see pt 2 above). Oops, there went another 2 Euros.I\'m amazed some people like this thing. The positive reviews must be from people who have never used a decent smart phone. It makes an iPhone seem like it came from some advanced extraterrestrial civilization, whereas the C3 was designed by greedy phone carriers and programmed by imbeciles. I can only imagine using it as a basic phone and for SMS messaging.'),(24,'B003V4AJSU','I bought three of these (non-Amazon purchase) phones for the family and they love them. I am writing this to inform the public who are having trouble configuring their phones for texting pictures or sending videos. I talked to a representative at the AT&T Corporate Center Store and chatted on-line through my AT&T account. The result is that you must have some type of a data plan to transmit the picture or video. I ask if the phone could be configured for the free pay-as-you-go feature in which the multimedia messaging uses the data plan but you will not be billed for the transmission. I was told that they have no way of knowing how to go around the AT&T network system. I conclude that you must have a data plan, but the use of data transmitted through the multimedia messaging will not go against your data plan\'s usage. This will occur when you are web surfing. If anyone out there can accomplish this differently, I sure would like to know. Now back to the phones, I bought silicone cases and a leather case for these phones and these products fit great. These items were purchase through Amazon.'),(25,'B003V4AJSU','I have had this phone for about a week and I LOVE it!Pros:Wifi baby!!!3.5mm headphone jack.

I have an 8gb micro sd card for it so it holds most my music, and I can browse the web, facebook, email, ect. on wifi while listening.I love this phone and would buy it again in a heartbeat.'),(26,'B003V4AJSU','I highly recommend if you only use this for calls and texting. Do not use for internet because it does lag. I gave this 3/5 stars because texting does need to get some getting use to. Keys are somewhat small-medium size and if you have stubby fingers like me you being to text slow at first then normal afterwards.Don\'t get me wrong, this is a great little phone. It comes with Wifi which is awesome btw! Only get this if you really want it. I am sure you can get touch-screen phones at about the same price. I find those types of phones easier to use for texting and surfing the web. that\'s just my opinions though.'),(27,'B003V4AJSU','THIS PHONE IS VERY GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE.

It has good sound quality, useful features, good fit-and-finish.  The speakerphone works exceptionally well.  I searched around for a decently priced phone (you can get this unlocked for $120 shipped) that could sync my contacts, calendar and task list, would work as a tethered modem, could link to an email account and had web access.  This is what I ended up with.The down side is that the sync software offered by Nokia is total crap.  DO NOT use the Ovi Suite software if you need to sync your Outlook data - it has a nasty habit of overwriting your Outlook data file. If you are lucky, it will just create a mess.  If you are unlucky - well, I hope you backed up your data lately.  Much less problematic is Nokia\'s PC Suite - it is the predecessor to Ovi Suit.  It too has problems (I could only get it to sync 30 contacts at a time) but it is much less buggy.  The down side to PC Suite is that Nokia is abandoning its support/updates for this software.  Right now, there are plenty of forums that provide good answers to common problems.If this phone does not have the features you want go to phonescoop.com and click on the \"phone finder\" link.  It is a GREAT time saver.  You put in the features you want it it will spit out a list of all phones with your criteria.'),(29,'B003V4AJSU','Nokia built a great phone with the C3-00. BUT - if you are a person that watches their wallet, this phone will not be for you. This phone MUST have an internet connection. With extreme difficulty, I was able to get it to connect via WIFI starting off at home. But as soon as I was out of range, or disconnected from WIFI, it jumps right to GPRS. And the transition back to WIFI is difficult to accomplish without re-booting the phone.  This was not what I expected. On my current Win5 OS phone, I control the connection to GPRS and WIFI, and I can enable or disable as I please. So I ultimately sent the phone back.  I specifically look for WIFI phones, but i must be able to control the connection. I refuse to purchase most new smartphones because they have a data package requirement. I am able to use my Win5 OS phone and connect when I can - and that suits me just fine. Better for me to connect when I want than to spend hundrends a year for a \'required\' connection.Thanks but no.'),(30,'B003V4AJSU','OK, well that is what my new C3 Nokia cell phone is, just OK. I have been searching for a replacement cell phone to my old Nokia C3 for a while.I give my old Nokia C3 a 4 star rating.  I don\'t want a \"smart phone\" but I do want the ability to get on the internet. My old C3 did not require a \"hot spot\" wifi to get on the internet, the phone I just purchased does. It does not have the WAP internet configuration on the phone like my old one does. I called AT&T and got no help. (its all about the money, because I did not buy the phone from them). Anyway my old phone still works for internet use, I love to read news from all over the country and all over the world. The old C3 can pick up the internet at times when my wife\'s I phone can\'t. I use the new phone for talking mainly, although I do use the hot spot wifi sometimes. You can\'t do the video or sound thing with these phones but I am not much into that anyway. the phone is sturdy and has easy to use functions. I would recommend this phone for someone who wants more that  a phone but does not want a smart phone with all the gadgets. The music you can store with the  memory card and the radio work good enough.'),(31,'B003V4AJSU','I don\'t care to pay for a data plan and needed a phone for talking and texting. I\'ve had this phone for a little over a year now. I have found it to be extremely tough and reliable. I have dropped it accidentally many times without a problem. The sound quality is great, including the speakerphone. Bluetooth works flawlessly with my Subaru. Texting works very well; I love the QWERTY keyboard. Battery life is fabulous - I only charge up about once a week or less.Cons would include the following: the number buttons are small, so dialing a number is hard to do without looking closely at the phone. I\'m not that bothered by that because I tend to call the same people again and again, who are saved as contacts. The web browsing is a joke. You have to float the arrow around with the up/down keys. After trying it once, I decided that I didn\'t care about that. I have an iPod which is perfect for utilzing WIFI.If what you want is a great, tough phone for talking and texting, with outstanding battery life, this is the phone for you. I bought it unlocked from Amazon and popped in my AT&T; sim card. It worked from day one without problem. Thanks, Amazon!'),(32,'B003V4AJSU','I needed a texting phone that did not require a data plan.  I also needed a Nokia as they have the best antenna and can get out when other cell phones can\'t.  Buyer beware!  This phone is very difficult to use. It locks after a few seconds of non-use and that can\'t be turned off!  The screen goes dark after only a few seconds of non-use and that too can not be changed.  It literally took hours to figure out how to use this phone.  An example:  I needed to find the call log.  After searching forever I finally stumbled across it under contacts.  Now that makes sense, why didn\'t I think of that.  The same problem occurred when trying to change the ring tone. Don\'t bother looking under settings.  The only good thing about the phone is that it does get out almost everywhere.  And..... no data plan required.'),(33,'B003V4AJSU','I bought this phone for a few reasons:+ full keyboard texting+ e-mail+ rare internet access+ overseas SIM useSo far I\'ve tried all the above features but the last one, and I\'ll be sure to update the review after testing the int\'l SIM.For the most part, what you see is what you get when it comes to features, and there aren\'t any surprises there.  But there are a few things to note:+ There is NO way to change the screen brightness.  I even checked to see if there are any free hacker apps to enable this, but there are none to be found.+ There is NO way to change the screen timeout function.  If you don\'t press a button, the screen will go dim and turn off after about 10 seconds.  And yes, this phone does play videos which makes this hardwired timeout just plain dumb.+ Music volume at the absolute lowest setting is still quite loud through my earbuds.  It makes music unbearable after a short time.+ Internet can be excruciatingly slow even at full signal strength.  I\'m talking WLAN here... haven\'t tried over GSM yet, but I can\'t imagine it\'s any faster.Overall, aside from a few MIA features, this is a fine phone for certain functions.  I was able to set up my nonstandard e-mail account quickly, and the phone has built in e-mail setup for Gmail, AOL, etc.  The Nokia store has a few free apps as well as pay ones of course.  Because the features are fairly limited, the menu tree is easy to navigate.  And if you DO want to listen to more music than the phone\'s meager internal memory will hold, there is a handy micro-SD slot for cards up to 8GB.'),(34,'B003V4AJSU','This phone was a gift to my wife and myself for christmas,  we both had Blackberrys before and now we wanted to change to Nokia because the fee to Blackberry data service is quite expensive in my country.Now, the Phone is not quite as they discribe it, the email es very very slow, you cant read office documents because there is not quickoffice available for this model. The phone lacks of many features that other phones in the same category have.I used to be a Nokia Fan, but after this one... that may change...'),(35,'B003V4AJSU','I like that Nokia phones are built to last, not like moto\'s or htc that barely make it a year.  This Nokia is no exception, works perfectly, built sturdy, looks like it will last a while.  The C3 has a metal backing, not cheap plastic, screen is crisp in color.  Phone call quality is very clear.  Everything overall is perfect, and the quality that is Nokia is known for.  The phone does not support 3g or 4g, but does have wifi.  The picture quality is not superb, but that is to be expected in a 2MP.  No matter what, you can\'t beat a better quality phone for this price.Its so awesome, I bought 2.  Yes, 2, so my husband could have one too.'),(36,'B003V4AJSU','I purchased this phone mainly for the music player feature. Secondly, for the beautiful color, and thirdly, for the wide blackberry-look. I loved the phone features except for the facebook app. It worked well initially but after t-mobile configured my phone to receive and send multi-media messages, the facebook app no longer worked, which is fine cause I didn\'t buy it for facebook anyway. The music player is off the chain! I love being able to listen to my music and use my favorite songs as ringtones. This phone is excellent. Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived after it apparently fell from my coat pocket at school and was never returned. I only had the pleasure of using it for 5 weeks. Also, I give this phone 4 stars not because of the phone itself, but mainly because Nokia has too many smart features on this phone requiring additional data packet. I got t-mobile\'s $15 plan since I didn\'t need to use web as much. Overall, love this phone so much I ordered another one, the C3 in hot pink, unfortunately, an international version but I am hoping it will work just as good.'),(37,'B003V4AJSU','This phone must be European origin - it has the Euro plug, but seller did supply an adapter.  More importantly it was in Portugese so you must be able to navigate to the language selection key to convert to English and the manual in the package is not in English, but I am sure you could download from Nokia.  This is a quality product that is simple to use.  It has the ability to use the internet and access social media, but the main function of the phone is to make phone calls and text!  It has the very user friendly Nokia format.  However you MUST order a Nokia headset to be hands free.  Other 3.5 mm headsets WILL NOT work.  This is the only drawback to Nokia phones that I have found.  Otherwise I am 100% happy with this phone!!  There are several ring options and wallpapers that are attractive.

The only reason that I did not return it was because I live in the Caribbean so when I calculated the cost to return it, I decided to keep it.'),(40,'B003V4AJSU','I got my first GSM qwerty phone for free when I renewed my contract in 2010.  It was a touchscreen Samsung with a slide-out keyboard.  Because the phone unlocks if the slider is budged, there was no way to secure the phone from pocket dialing.  While I was camping one night the phone called 911 four times even though I had \"locked\" it.  I couldn\'t access my employer voicemail with this phone because it had no hard keys, and the screen keypad presented no pound sign (#) which is needed to get into my voicemail system.  And, if my cheek brushed the screen on other voicemail systems, it would activate a number on the screen causing the message to be deleted, passed, saved, etc.So I paid retail to my provider (GCI) for my next phone, an Alcatel qwerty candybar style phone.  Although I wanted a non-touchscreen phone, GCI only sells GSM texters that have touchscreen menu systems even if they have hard keys for texting and dialing.  This phone had a better locking scheme than the Samsung but it too was regularly defeated in my pocket (but it did not make spurious 911 calls).Both the Samsung and Alcatel are of high quality but I hate them for their touchscreens.So...A couple of months ago I bought the unlocked Nokia C3-00 phone from Amazon.  It is a dream compared to my other phones.  The radio has far better FM reception than the Samsung or Alcatel; the battery lasts WAY longer than my past phones; the menu system is natural, better designed, and faster than the touchscreens; the keypad is easy to see and has a very good touch; the screen quality is bright and clear; and the phone STAYS locked when you lock it.  Call quality is excellent.  WiFi is easy and fast, and I remain happy not to spend an extra $30 per month (PLUS data plan cost) to have a smart phone.Two teensy cons for me with this phone, both cheaply resolved:(1) The back of body of this solidly built phone is slick.  I don\'t want the phone falling out of my breast pocket or my hand so I ordered from Amazon \"Amzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case for Nokia C3 - Black by Amzer\" for about $10.  The case slips on perfectly and keeps the phone comfortably secure while I am on a call; and it keeps the phone in one place no matter where I put it down.  It also muffles the Nokia\'s enthusiastic vibration when I want to be alerted to a call or text but don\'t want to buzz the desktop.(2) The sound quality of the comfortable and ergonomically well-designed earbuds is muffled-sounding.  So I simply substitute the original earbuds from an old iPod.  They are sufficient for providing the Nokia\'s superior FM reception and they sound better than the Nokia buds.When my cell phone contract comes up in a couple of months I will take a free phone if I can get the little Samsung ruggedized waterproof phone for when I\'m camping or fishing.  But I will keep using the Nokia C3-00 as my primary phone beause it is perfect for my normal pattern of phone usage.'),(41,'B003V4AJSU','this phone has what they call a \"POWERSAVER\" feature.while is ok to save battery life the phone goes dark every 9 seconds no matter what your doing on it. I\'ve called Nokia & it has NO option to disable it. surfing the web reading online you have to push any button over and over and over to keep in from going dark. What a pain in the ass.you have NO idea how much this sucks until you start using it.this completely takes away from everything that\'s good about this phone. don\'t waste your $$ buy a blackberry 9780 or newer'),(42,'B003V4AJSU','The phone works ok, but sound quality is not very good, it sounds rather like holding a tin can up to your ear. The Wi-Fi connectivity is nice and works well, I\'ve used it both at home and in a hotel room. The internet browser is surprisingly fast but the memory fills up very fast too, due to the small RAM. Bluetooth works well with my MacBook Pro for file transfers, both sending music to the phone memory card and sending photos/videos from the phone to the MacBook. The bluetooth also works in our 2011 Toyota Sienna, at least as far as making and receiving calls, but the stereo music features do not work at all. The camera is adequate but unimpressive and photos look grainy. The full keyboard while small is nice, although I do no texting and only very little emailing. It\'s also nice to be able to customize (some) button functions and on-screen shortcuts.'),(43,'B003V4AJSU','Since I was due for an early upgrade on my plan, I checked around in the AT&T; store for non-smartphone messaging-only options that did not require a data plan.  Sadly, there were just a handful of options, half of which were unappealing flip style phones that I used over 10 years ago.  AT&T; store personnel stated that AT&T; is intentionally driving existing customers to higher revenue smartphone and data plans and de-emphasizing messaging-only phones.*sigh*.  Thanks for reducing customer options AT&T.;So the search began to see what options existed in third party unlocked phones.  The Nokia C3-00 caught my eye largely because it looked very much like my previous QWERTY bar phone, but it also had FM stereo and Wifi capability which had the potential to dramatically improve its day-to-day flexibility.  In addition, user reviews across multiple internet review sites gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews.Before purchase I had some initial concerns about whether or not AT&T; would identify the phone on their network as a smartphone since it uses the Symbian S40 operating system.  AT&T; said the phone\'s IMEI number is not among their list of smartphone IMEI\'s.  I\'ve gone through my first billing cycle and can confirm no forced smartphone data plan charges were assessed.As for the phone itself, day-to-day use has been great.  Plugged my SIM card into it from the old phone (Pantech Link) and its worked beautifully right out of the box from day one.  No problems at all.Battery life is typically 3-4 days between charges with moderate texting and several hours of daily FM stereo usage at work.  Better than expected.Wifi works OK, not very speedy, but it does enable access to personal email and MSNBC/CNN at Starbucks.  Just don\'t expect an iPhone-type browsing experience.  It\'s basic but gets the job done.  Better than expected.  Note: If you DO opt for a data plan for this phone, bear in mind that it\'s an EDGE phone, not a 3G phone, so your data transfer speeds under a paid data plan will likely be a little underwhelming.FM stereo works super and is a nice inclusion on a phone at this price level.  Earphone cord acts as the antenna and must be plugged in for reception.  Sounds great, and again, better than expected.Keyboard is typical QWERTY layout.  I found the tactile feedback quite pleasant and was easier to text on it than previous phone.Call quality is very good.  No dropped calls.  I can hear callers loud and clear and they can hear me the same.Nothing bothersome about the texting experience.  It has a conversation mode similar to other phones and it works well.  Only complaint is that individual texts within a conversation will only display the first two lines of the text.  You have to drill into the text to see it fully.  Not terribly annoying, but adds an extra step to the texting process.  I suppose you have to accept some compromises when working with a 2.4 in display screen.Overall, I\'d have have to say this has been a terrific phone choice for me.  At $99, it\'s priced very well, offers expanded feature content and NO DATA PLAN requirement. It\'s a worthy option to similar carrier-provided messaging phones and a great value. Very happy camper.'),(44,'B003V4AJSU','Firstly, it\'s a great price for an unlocked phone that can be used with AT&T;, TMobile, prepaid, and any other GSM (SIM card) service providers worldwide. I\'m not going to repeat the technical specifications. It is very light, portable and has excellent battery life. You can talk for a really long time. Make sure to turn off WIFI when it\'s not being used. This phone is perfect for everyday use, or as a backup or a second phone. I love the FM radio.It also makes a decent gift.I would recommend it over any carrier branded phone. It is always cheaper in the long run to get an unsubsidized phone.'),(45,'B003V4AJSU','When you first pick up the Nokia C3, you can think that you have a modern looking full QWERTY Blackberry. It is a cool looking phone, with a very easy to use keyboard.Its light weight, so it dosent feel heavy in your pocked, has great battery life. The sound clarity is good, as is the camera. Its not a high end camera phone, but its pictures are just as clear as my old 8900.It dosent compare with the high end smart phones like the new Blackberries or HTC androids, but for the $160 range that its in, it certainly gives you that expensive look, and is a great email/messaging device.'),(46,'B003V4AJSU','I love this phone because of the easy to use QWERTY keyboard.I always call it a wanna be smart phone!This is only the second cell phone I have ever owned...my first one was a Samsung flip phone without a camera.If you are looking for a fancy phone then buy one, this is just a nice phone with some nice extras.I love that I can do facebook, email and surf the net at home or in hot spots.It saves a lot of money because you do not have to lock in to an expensive phone plan if you are just looking for a replacement phone....I just used this to replace my old phone.However, what I don\'t like about the phone is that it isn\'t always user friendly, and if you are technically challenged like I am it can get a bit frustrating at times to figure out what you are doing.Luckily, if you go to the nokia site you will find a great discussion board where people can give you solutions about how to use this and that option or any problem that come up.The mannual that comes with the phone is useless.I have also called nokia customer service with some questions, and they have been helpful.I must warn that when it says \"US Version\", it really means that it is an international phone with an American adaptor.I didn\'t like this because I thought I was getting a US phone.The seller sent me free of charge an original nokia US charger, I am pleased that he offered to do that.But, the charger cord is a little short which can make it difficult to talk on while it is charging.Words like color are colour, favorite is favourite...so uses British English.That doesn\'t bother me so much, though.The apps aren\'t great, but I don\'t really use apps anyway.The numbers are hard to find, but all in all you get used to the quirks and realize that you have a lot for the money.The camera isn\'t bad, but the video is really short.Just not as users friendly as I thought it would be, but I would buy it again simply because of internet access, and the QWERTY key pad is easy to use.I love texting on this phone, but I had a problem with sending and receiving photos.Found out the phone has to be programmed, and you have to either call nokia or find an answer on the Nokia discussion board.Don\'t be afraid to buy...especially if you know a lot about cell phones or if you have someone who can help you figure it out.My engineer husband helped me get it all set up, but I am still trying to figure out some of the technical issues.Sweet little phone for the price.'),(47,'B003V4AJSU','So despite some of the negative reviews I still decided to buy the phone and I was disappointed with this purchase. This is my first Nokia. I have been a loyal SE customer for many years and since my C905a broke, I thought why not give another brand a try? Overall, I think I prefer SE models more. Maybe it\'s because I\'ve gotten so used to them but I think their UI is just more user friendly. However, I have gotten use to this phone and I do like it. I love the fact that it has a lot of smartphone features. The wireless internet is awesome. I don\'t have to worry about the stupid data plan AT&T makes you sign up for. I like all the many shortcut buttons. So even without the widget bar, I still have access to most of my applications. However, I think it\'s the luck of the draw. Some reviewers had no problem with this phone but within the first couple of days of using it, it would just freeze up and shut down on me. So frustrating! And video playback sucks. Everytime I would play a video the screen would freeze after just a few seconds. Plus no volume rocker. I knew the phone didn\'t have one but I didn\'t realize how much I would miss it! I like to listen to music while I\'m doing other stuff on the phone. There\'s no way to skip to the next song or change the station or adjust the volume other than quitting the application you\'re doing and going back to your media player. (I guess I\'m spoiled from my other SE phones.) I do have my phone settings like ringtones and such set to files on my SD card. And everytime I would take the card out and put it back in, my settings would be reset to the original. What the heck?! So I\'m sending it back and because I do like the brand, I\'m going to give Nokia one more chance and upgrade it to a C6 and try their touch screen phones now. I\'m crossing my fingers that the upgraded model will have gotten most of the bugs out and I won\'t have the same problems. If not, I think I\'ll have to go back to my SE roots and give W995a a try instead. So if you\'re thinking of buying this phone, I would recommending upgrading and getting an E5 instead.'),(48,'B003V4AJSU','If I can rate this defective cell phone with Zero Star, I would give it Zero-star, but I think my only option is to rate it 1-star. Just like the Prior Unhappy Buyer of this Same device did a few months ago, I have to return this crappy cell phone to the UPS store tomorrow morning (Jan 6, 2012) for a 100% refund. I\'ll explain below how I know there is a Prior Unhappy Buyer of this defective Cell Phone.Today (Jan 5, 2012), I\'m extremely disappointed about 5 minutes after I opened the package. First, I noticed a PRIOR UNHAPPY BUYER returned this piece of crap, defective cell phone in October 2011 (just a few months before me). The \"Return due to Defective Product\" notice dated in October 2011 was still attached to the package sent to me. The seller is Warehouse Deals, Inc which is a subsidiary of Amazon. The seller Warehouse Deals, Inc must be thinking that if the Nokia C3-00 is defective in one unhappy buyer\'s eyes, it must not be defective in the next buyer\'s eyes. HELLO! Defective is defective - it means internally mal-functioning, it\'s not merely external/superficial beauty in the eyes of the beholder.I have owned several older Nokia cell phone models, so I began testing several functions. Immediately, I noticed that the Right and Left Key (just above the alpha & numeric keyboards) are not responsive when I try to select on-screen options. The only time the Right key works is when switching on/off the device. I gave my benefit of the doubt by pressing the key at different strength: hard, medium and soft, but nothing worked. Then I immediately went to online chat with Nokia online support to explain my problems with this device. The Nokia online support confirm what I know about Nokia devices from my own experience, that it is NOT normal for the Right and Left Key not to be responsive to on-screen selections (in other words, I wouldn\'t need to press more than 1 key to pick on-screen selections). On all my prior Nokia cell phone, you only need to press 1-key (either the Right or Left key to select your on-screen option).I\'ve had a string of bad luck ordering this Nokia C3-00 unlocked cell phone (a very long story, prior to receiving this defective cell phone, I made at least 3 telephone complaints about an Amazon Rep. called Amit Y. who made unauthorized cancellation on 2 good, valid and in-stock orders without my permission. This is really testing my patience on purchasing electronic devices from Amazon. I am totally disappointed with this device and I will return this crappy defensive cell phone at the UPS store tomorrow morning for a refund.'),(49,'B003V4AJSU','I researched phones for months.  I\'m a devoted fan of Nokia.  I make calls, receive calls and text a little.  I didn\'t want to be forced to get a data plan, but I still wanted to have the internet option.  This phone is it.  The battery life with my use is 7-9 days!!!!!  (That\'s no internet use at all.)  I have the internet, but I don\'t use it at this time.  This phone looks great, performs great and is overall excellent for my simple needs.  Reception great.  Volume great.  THE MAJOR PROBLEM I EXPERIENCED (AND CONQUERED WITH LOTS OF HELP) WAS GETTING MY INTERNET AND MMS SETTINGS CONFIGURED! I couldn\'t send or receive pictures via text and I couldn\'t get on the internet.  AT&T; tech employees could not help with this at all.  I was told that this phone, though unlocked, wouldn\'t receive internet or mms messages because it was not an AT&T; phone.  (My C3 does not have AT&T; printed anywhere on it.)  This was absolutely not true!  I got HELP from a review posted on May 23, 2011 here on this review list for the C3.  I had to do a little extra research and tweak the \"formula\" a bit, but it all eventually worked.  I can send and receive pictures (MMS) and I get the internet.  Look into these reviews for help, have patience and it should eventually work out for you.  A few reviews have these steps listed, but with several of these entries: \"[...]\".

Just received item today and everything was exactly as described online and of course, brand new. Easily put in my former SIM card and got my AT&T contacts and whatnot. Great buy, will update if any problems. Oh yeah the backlight on this phone is in unchangeable. It times out after 5 seconds and the brightness can\'t be adjusted. The phone is pretty bright in a darkroom when you are going to bed! Those are the only real downsides. The Internet works wonderfully with your home wifi access and so far it is free!

Good luck :)'),(51,'B003V4AJSU','The look, feel and function are very satisfying. Got it for my wife because she wants to start texting and she loves it.  I just took the sim card from the old ATT phone (the card actually say Cingular so it goes back in time) and plugged it in and everything worked with no problems and no interaction with anybody at ATT. It is unlocked so I didn\'t have to commit to a contract, just keep paying monthly. I also got it for me to use as our travel phone when going overseas since it is quad band GSM. So far haven\'t used it for that yet.'),(52,'B003V4AJSU','I\'ve had this phone for about a month now.  I like it a lot.  It doesn\'t have 3G capability but I don\'t really need that.  I looks very nice and feels durable.  The keyboard is much easier to use than my previous phone.  I read several reviews that said multimedia messaging is unavailable for AT&T customers.  That\'s not true.  You just have to set some options on the phone that you can find on AT&T\'s website.  Also, several people said the phone had horrible reception.  My phone did as well, until I got the software upgrade that is available from Nokia.  I used a wireless connection to download the upgrade.  Now the phone works great.  The only thing I haven\'t been happy with is I can\'t seem to download apps from the Nokia App store.  There are lots of apps that show up as available for the phone until you try to download them.  Then they say they are not compatible with the phone.  I can live with that.'),(53,'B003V4AJSU','I love this phone.  I have always been a Nokia fan, but for my last upgrade, I was looking to switch to a QWERTY phone for easy text-messaging, and I discovered that all the technology is going into smartphones, meaning there are very few decent-quality dumbphones available.  For my current upgrade, I did some extensive research and decided to go back to Nokia.  First of all, I was very happy to have the return of what I think would be expected features on any phone, like a decent calendar and calculator app, and reminders.  Here are the other pros/cons of this phone:PROS:1. wIfi-  the internet available on this phone is not going to make smartphone users happy, but it makes me happy that I can download wallpapers and ringtones without using data2. conversational text messaging- it doesn\'t look like an iphone or anything, but it serves it\'s purpose so you don\'t have to scroll through your sent messages to see what you were talking about when someone replies a few hrs later3. customizable- you can make all the shortcut buttons do what you want them to do, so you won\'t accidentally connect to the internet all the time, and can easily access the features that you do use. you can also customize the appearance of the homescreen with preferred shortcuts, such as top contacts, etc4. can check time and missed calls/messages by just pressing the hangup button, do not need to unlock keypad5. nice display, camera is decent, easy to navigate, user-friendly, can change call volume during a call by pressing the navigation key6. Battery life is AMAZING!  I used it a lot when I first got it to set it up with some wifi use, and it lasted me 8 1/2 days before my first charge.  During the second week of regular use but no wifi, I am now on the 8th day and still have half the battery life remaining.7. Feels sturdy and well-madeCONS:1. Mine came in portugese.  There is a utube video that demonstrates how to change the language, so it is fine.  There are a few keys you won\'t use, but no big deal.  Came with European charger and a converter.2. Keyboard is a little small for typing.  I am getting used to it, but still have some typos.3. Media messaging and internet do not work when you first get it.  Need to configure it.  The instructions are listed in one of the Amazon reviews by user P Redman (thanks!).  I am going to copy and paste below because it is tough to find the specific review.  Once configured, everything works great.So after the few quick fixes when the phone arrives, the only real con is a small keyboard.  Overall, a great phone and does everything I had hoped for and more.

Features aren\'t bad. Has cool backgrounds and some okay ringtones. However, I am discovering with unlocked phones there are things you cannot do since it seems that data usage is totally disabled on these phones, however that is not specific to this phone but to some unlocked phones in general, such as sending pictures in text messages. This so far seems to be a good, reliable phone with good battery life. I recommend getting the jelly case in case the phone is dropped,Amzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case for Nokia C3 - Black, for pretty cheap the phone is protected against hard floors and other disasters.'),(55,'B003V4AJSU','Wow, Nokia finally hit it right. This is a great phone although it dosen\'t have the modern G4 speeds. That\'s a best kept secret. It makes for longer battery life because it isn\'t always searching for the high speed port. The WIFI is smple and easy to get up and going. I have fairly large fingers and the qwerty keyboard is not that hard to maneuver. Texting is now much simpler as is email and messaging.Best of all it is very user friendly and easy to get what you want out of it. Nokia backs it pretty well with lots of free apps and games. I will finally retire my RAZR for this one.This is the one if you have previously given up on battery life and basic functionality.'),(56,'B003V4AJSU','I\'m on a contract with T-Mobile, and I wanted to get a new phone while still on the contract, so I initially got the Nokia C1-01, which I bought from Amazon as well, however I didn\'t have access to picture messaging nor internet. I thought that for $120 on Amazon, that the Nokia C3-00 was a steal that combined a good amount of features like wi-fi and EDGE network access and custom shortcuts balanced with a reasonable and frugal price, so I got it.When the phone arrived, it was as simple as just swapping the SIM cards (as it usually is with any GSM phone, and some newer CDMA phones) from my old phone with the Nokia C3-00; I still wasn\'t able to use picture messaging, but I was sold on the Wi-Fi, the EDGE network support and the Mail and Contacts custom shortcuts.I started doing some occasional internet browsing with the phone; while not all websites are available or nicely viewed on the phone, Google Mobile adapted most of the webpages to be viewed with the phone. While on Wi-Fi I was able to attain speeds of 1500 kbps (kilobits). The phone was UNLOCKED !!!! I was finally going to be able to run Gmail and Google Maps without having to get a Blackberry or an iPhone, and it did so beautifully (read the instructions on how to use Google maps, otherwise you\'ll be a little frustrated when trying to pan in/out and zoom in/out the map).One good day TMOBILE sent me an update, and the phone did ask me if I wanted to apply the update, but I must have pressed the wrong key and it applied the update which rendered my phone unable to do all the nice things that it was able to do before: I was left with a boring gray background, only the Nokia ringtone left to choose, the custom shortcut keys no longer worked (couldn\'t even choose something else for them to do), and clicking on the browser did nothing.To cut a long story short, I called Tmobile asking them why they were sending updates to my phone...they were not aware. They told me that they couldn\'t provide me with much support since I had bought the phone from somebody else...that\'s perfectly understandable.I was however expecting good customer support from Nokia and they failed to deliver: I called a total of 5 times that solved nothing, and in between those calls, Nokia would advice every time to contact T-Mobile to provide me with values to access the web..I just couldn\'t get them to understand that it was the applications that failed to respond. I was asking to return the phone to its factory OS condition. They got me to update the phone from OS version 4 to 8, but did nothing either.I am looking now at going to some sort of Android OS phone....Symbian is just dead and you can\'t get as much info.The phone itself is a nice one, but since I assume that you\'ll be buying it to run on either AT&T; or T-Mobile, I just wanted to warn you about what could happen to you, and complain about the poor Nokia support'),(57,'B003V4AJSU','I am a 50-something woman, and needed a new cell after the navigation button on my pretty blue Samsung SGH 600 slider no longer navigated. This terminated a friendship that had lasted many years. The Samsung had all I had ever wanted from a phone and I didn\'t really see the need for a smart phone. I was looking for quality, something that did the job, and had a touch of flair. I picked the Nokia C3 based on the Amazon feedback.At first it drove me crazy, mostly because I was still thinking in the Samsung way. The more I played with it, the more it became mine. I like it, but I am not in love with it. I whished it didn\'t look so much like a business phone - more color options would be nice.

Long battery life, ability to use wifi in coffee shops and airports,  intuitive software setup, it\'s all good.

The reviews were brilliant and all, but it was a different story after it arrived. I\'ve had it for five (5) months now. I use a MacBook Pro for syncing contacts and calendars and I have had no issues with that.The OS (Symbian 3) is very sluggish, sometimes outright unresponsive. There was some improvement after installing the update released in February by Nokia, however I\'m still having to restart the phone ever so often and because of that I\'ve installed only two (2) apps on my phone: Skype and Opera, both of which work really well. After installing whatsapp via the Ovi store and having my phone crash repeatedly to the point where I had to have it replaced, there is a reluctance to install applications (despite my doing the necessary research) - and this undermines the original intent of the purchase.The battery life is a lot less than what I had come to expect of Nokia. Recent models I\'ve had include the N76, E50, and E73. Nokia ought to have done way better.The phone\'s WiFi drops connections ever so often.On the upside, the screen is really nice, the body is sturdy and feels of really good quality, very attractive on the whole. The bluetooth has a really long range which was a pleasant surprise. It is nice how the screens are customizable. The hardware specs are really good, impressive actually, but Nokia fell down badly in terms of the quality of the N8 firmware to allow users to make the most of it.I would not purchase a Nokia smartphone again.

Used it in Alaska Snowboarding for music while I lived there, used it back-country fishing/camping, used it doing construction projects were sawdust would go everywhere, etc.  Literally dropped this phone at least 500 times with the otterbox case in it.  Most durable phone Ive ever owned.Battery:  Had phone 3+ years with the SAME battery.  Finally got a new phone today to replace it. Battery life is amazing. Took the N8 out camping from Friday Night through Monday afternoon (on airplane mode the whole time)and took about 100 pics and my phone is still running without having charged it.  Actually, it has not been charged still and its Tuesday night. Amazing.GPS:Typical, but I like that the map works offline.HDMI:Check, what other smartphones have HDMI??!?!Data Use: Some carriers don\'t consider this phone a smartphone and you can get unlimited internet for a VERY low price -- say $5-6 a month if you catch my drift.'),(62,'B003ZX7RL4','I had my N8 for about a week before T-Mobile had its \"All Phones Are Free\" Valentine\'s Day promotion.  I\'d definitely grown to appreciate the N8 in this time, having upgraded from a strictly call-and-text phone, but I couldn\'t shake my curiosity for the open-source Android OS.  So on T-Mobile\'s sale day, I went and grabbed a Samsung Galaxy S II for \"free\" (still $400 over a 2 year contract) -- probably the most powerful phone you can currently buy, and with the flashy Android platform, it should have been instant love... but it only took one evening to realize the N8 already had everything I wanted, and actually does some stuff better.I\'m not crazy about Google to begin with (privacy policy stuff) so I was disappointed to discover that with Android you\'re basically forced to use your Google account to access many of the applications, including the app market.  Besides that, it just felt like too much phone.  And contrary to popular belief, I didn\'t find the Android OS to be any easier to use than Nokia\'s Symbian OS, and in fact for the most part they look pretty similar.  Plus, Nokia is known to make beautiful hardware, and the N8 is a great example -- eye catching design, functional buttons, and the weighty feeling of a quality product.  I\'m only slightly disappointed with the Ovi store, which doesn\'t boast as many apps as the other guys.  But as someone else said, it has the ones you need and not the ones you don\'t (but let me know if you find one for a dvorak keyboard...).Everything else I\'ve played with so far has worked wonderfully, including maps (with GPS and a compass), music player, web browsing (use Opera Mobile), and the camera is better than any I\'ve had before, digital or otherwise.  Bottom line is, Nokia is still the best in the business, and Symbian OS is plenty adequate for doing stuff on a phone.  Don\'t buy into the hype of Android phones (or the iPhone, for that matter) because you\'ll probably end up returning it after one day like I did.'),(63,'B003ZX7RL4','I tryied voice command mode  and is  very useful.  Very nice to hear who is calling when the caller ID  in the phone reads loud the name you put in your contact list.  I love to connect the Bluetooth mode just saying  \"bluetooth\"  and my phone open that mode for easy connect my handsfree, and then just disconnect saying again the command.To access the voice command, just keep press for 5 seconds the option in the homescreen that is for opening the phone keyboard for making a call. To use more options check later all the different options in voice  commands available in the phone configuration.The only thing is be carefull when you hard reset the phone (got to do that because had problems with Ovi Store), because you can loose all the pics, videos that came preinstalled (Tron, etc).....!'),(64,'B003ZX7RL4','Loved, still love my first Nokia phone.  Still have it and use it but it is not a smartphone and it\'s more of a &#34;house phone&#34; than a cell phone.  I did a lot of research and when it came down to the iphone or this, I chose this.  Sure, it is great for texting.  Takes decent picture but there is a lag on the shutter and even though it\'s a 10mp camera, it doesn\'t take all that great of pictures.This phone came with Symbian Anna.  I had no idea that Belle was possible for an upgrade until about a month later.  Belle greatly improved on Anna but certain features were missing, I lost all of the apps I previously downloaded for free on Anna but now have to pay for on Belle, and the ringtones are sub par compared to Anna.  That was fixable by going to a forum to download Anna\'s ringtones.  I added them to my phone so that was cool.  The system has plenty of apps, which is all fine and dandy but most new companies are only making apps for Android and iPhone.  They are not bothering to make compatible apps for Symbian interfaces.  I can\'t even access certain websites because I cannot download and use google chrome as a browser and cannot access google play.I\'m not an app whore but there are certain apps by certain companies that I\'d like to utilize and I can\'t and that is frustrating.This phone is good for texting.  Web surfing is a bit slow but suffices for what I need on a phone.  Sending images is also easy.  There are some pluses like meeting mode, offline and online mode, etc.Another issue that occurs a lot with this phone is that it freezes a lot, for no reason, and I don\'t even have that many apps or anything on my phone.  I have to hold the power button on the phone and sometimes that doesn\'t even work for shutting it off at first.  Sometimes, I just have to sit and wait a few minutes and try again.This phone was my second of this model.  The first I ordered had an imperfection on the camera lens and I had to exchange it.  That took 2-3 weeks to work itself out and I only had a 30 day window to try out the phone and see if all worked fine.Overall, I\'m very disappointed with this phone.  I was a dedicated Nokia fan but now I\'m in the market for a new phone and it\'s only been six months.  My last Nokia kept (still keeps) me happy and it\'s been four years.  Too bad it isn\'t a smart phone.  It\'s a shame.  The phone itself is rather sturdy and feels great in my hands.  Perfect size, pleasing to the eye.  It just doesn\'t fit my needs.I do not expect any of you to consider my opinion as my review is not a techie rant but there are some valid points and I thought I\'d share.'),(65,'B003ZX7RL4','I just got this phone a few weeks ago, and already it is the worst phone I could have ever bought!! I can not use the internet. When I get phone calls, the sound is really bad and quite. The pictures are ok, but do not look like they are from a 12mp camera. The screen is so small, that even with my reading glasses, I have a horrible time reading anything. The keyboards are way to small to text with. If you have vision problems, I would not get this phone. I had a hard time finding anything on this phone. I really feel like I wasted my money on this phone.'),(66,'B003ZX7RL4','I LOVE my Nokia N8.  I travel a lot in Europe and the US, and not only has it replaced my old phone, it has handily replaced my point-and-shoot camera as well.  The photos and videos I have taken over the past couple of months are of excellent quality, rivaling my older DSLR camera (and it\'s so much smaller!)  The N8 has also worked with every mobile network I\'ve bought a SIM for, so it has excellent call reception both in the US and in every European country I\'ve tried.Some people try to malign the N8 for its Symbian operating system, but I really don\'t find it a major problem.  The user interface I find more or less as easy to use as Android, and there have been several UI improvements, with more on the way.  There are not as many apps in the Nokia Ovi Store as there are in the Android Marketplace, but the apps available are most often of high quality and utility.  (Especially check out Gravity, a brilliant social media app for Twitter/Facebook/Foursquare users!)In summary:  for the serious cameraphone enthusiast, the camera module\'s excellent lens and 12MP sensor, combined with the outstanding call quality and versatility, outweigh any minor niggles with the OS.  If your primary concerns are camera quality and/or call quality, there really is nothing else better on the market right now than the Nokia N8.'),(67,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ve been complimented several times on the photo quality for pictures taken with this phone but the most impressive thing is the video quality, the N8 shoots 720p (that\'s HD people!).  I then was able to connect my N8 to my Panasonic Plasma TV to show off my HD videos to family and friends.  This was done using the HDMI adapter (comes included with the N8) and a regular HDMI cable I purchased from Amazon.The application I use most is ovi Maps, the free Nokia tool that turns your phone into a GPS receiver.  That has rescued me several times already when driving (or walking) around in unknown places.Other applications I use on the N8:  gmail, ebookreader (currently reading \"A Tale of Two Cities\", my first e-book), angry birds.  Some applications come with the phone, some you have to download and from these, some are free, and some are not.Other features I use from the phone are wi-fi and 3G for internet connectivity, both work seamlessly.I\'ve had a lot of fun with the N8 since I got it on early November of 2010 (that\'s about 3 months ago).My previous smartphone had a slide-out keyboard and that\'s just about the only thing I miss (and just a little bit) from my old phone.The operating system on this phone is Symbian^3, which came out in 2010, so the applications developed for Symbian^3 may not yet be many, but so far this hasn\'t been an issue for me at all.I also got the Nokia CC-1005 silicone cover for my phone, it\'s hard to find, but it fits great, protects the phone from scratches and falls and makes the phone look cooler (according to my niece).Oh, and I almost forgot, I can also make and receive calls with the N8, call quality is excellent.Liking the N8 is what motivated me to write this review, I hope it is useful to you.'),(68,'B003ZX7RL4','&#1042;&#1099;&#1089;&#1083;&#1072;&#1083;&#1080; &#1090;&#1077;&#1083;&#1077;&#1092;&#1086;&#1085; &#1073;&#1099;&#1074;&#1096;&#1080;&#1081; &#1074; &#1091;&#1087;&#1086;&#1090;&#1088;&#1077;&#1073;&#1083;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1080;, &#1085;&#1077; &#1088;&#1072;&#1073;&#1086;&#1090;&#1072;&#1083;&#1072; &#1074;&#1085;&#1091;&#1090;&#1088;&#1077;&#1085;&#1085;&#1077;&#1103; &#1087;&#1072;&#1084;&#1103;&#1090;&#1100;. &#1055;&#1083;&#1086;&#1093;&#1086;&#1081; &#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1076;&#1072;&#1074;&#1077;&#1094;, &#1074;&#1099;&#1089;&#1083;&#1072;&#1083; &#1090;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;&#1088; &#1087;&#1083;&#1086;&#1093;&#1086;&#1075;&#1086; &#1082;&#1072;&#1095;&#1077;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1072;, &#1076;&#1072;&#1078;&#1077; &#1082;&#1086;&#1084;&#1087;&#1083;&#1077;&#1082;&#1090;&#1072;&#1094;&#1080;&#1103; &#1086;&#1083;&#1080;&#1095;&#1072;&#1083;&#1072;&#1089;&#1100; &#1086;&#1090; &#1085;&#1072;&#1096;&#1077;&#1081;, &#1085;&#1077;&#1093;&#1074;&#1072;&#1090;&#1072;&#1083;&#1072; &#1089;&#1080;&#1083;&#1080;&#1082;&#1086;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1086;&#1075;&#1086; &#1095;&#1077;&#1093;&#1083;&#1072;.'),(69,'B003ZX7RL4','When I bought the phone, Anna had been announced, but it was not available for my phone. I bought the phone for its amazing features. It has the best camera (or atleast one of the top three) available on it, which is a HUGE plus for me. It has USB to go, an HDMI out, decent amount of memory with the capability to add more (upto 32gb via mini sdHC cards); in short I was really excited to get the phone. When I got it though, I wasn\'t impressed at all, it came with the orignal symbian s^3 OS, which was laggy and slow, and simply made me annoyed. I thought the phone is slow, or it doesnt have enough processing power. And I really wanted to get rid of it, until Anna was finally released. Anna is the fastest operating system I\'ve used on any phone (other being iOS, and android). It runs smooth and seemlessly, and is simple to use. Made me fall in love with the phone all over again. Fast forward a few months, and Belle came along. Another WoW! Its simply beautiful, and I love how customizable it is. You can set each home screen however you want, and have custom settings for the horizontal and vertical orientations, with icons and widgets of different sizes. Belle, atleast for me, doesn\'t run as fast as Anna, but it isn\'t bad at all considering it was built for phones with twice the memory and processing power. Also, it only takes time to load when you\'re looking at something for the first time. For example, say you haven\'t checked your second,(or 3rd or,4th, or 5th, or 6th)home screen in a while (about 15 min to an hour). When you swipe to see the home screen, it takes about 1 or 2 seconds to load and update all the widgets you have on that particular home screen. Once its loaded, you can swipe back and forth seemlessly, and everything will be loaded & ready for you. The reason it takes a few seconds the first time is becuase it avoids storing un-needed information for prolonged periods in your RAM. This in turn saves your battery, and thats the reason I can get by a day or two or more without having to re-charge whereas my sister who uses android can\'t go any more than a few hours or a day with the same kind of usage.In short, Now I have a mini-HDMI to DVI-D converter (bought it at amazon), and also Nokia\'s RCA Cable (Fits in the 3.5mm jack on top). So I can hook up a monitor, an old TV, or a new HD tv to my phone. Connect my phone to a Keyboard and mouse via USB or bluetooth and I have a fully funtional computer that I can use to make assignments & presentation. Its a perfect balance of work and play, thats basically what I got the phone for, and I\'m very happy with it.After seeing Belle, I really hope Nokia would keep making symbian phones, atleast for the high-end market, coz there is truly nothing as good out there (although I\'ve heard good things about Meego too, but I\'ve never personally used it).Cheers to the hardware & software makers of the N8, Anna, & Belle!'),(70,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this unlocked phone for use in South America.When it arrived I charged it up, inserted my existing SIM card & powered it up.Worked perfectly & connected with my carrier.It takes a little getting used to but once you know your way around it it\'s easy to use & operate.It doesn\'t have Google chat which I understand they are working on.Another need is a button to reopen pages you are surfing rather than having to try & tap them open which can be frustrating.One great benefit is that you can see Gmail in HTML mode rather than mobile mode.This opens all your folder links & helps to permanently delete SPAM.The camera & video is out of this world for a phone.We had flooding over the last week & I was able to take high quality photos & video. No need for another digital camera.All in all a great job from Nokia.Just fix the 2 small problems & I\'ll be even happier'),(71,'B003ZX7RL4','I got the phone directly from Amazon while I still had my Blackberry 9700. I wanted to handle a touch phone.Pros:- big screen- good video capabilities plays a lot of formats- good sound.- HDMI port can come in handy sometimes.Cons:- 12 MPx Camera? I got crappy pics out of it. My VGA webcam takes better pics. Either that or there was something wrong with the Amazon stock. I\'ve read good reviews about the camera on this one but I got really bad pics. the pics were hazy like the light balance was not right.- Here is the thing with touch screens. They have to work perfectly or else it is just bad mood for the user. The buttons on a keypad for some reason gets more patience out of users. I felt the OS of the phone is a little quirky. Not really up to competition. Not smooth at all.The phone has a lot of features, promise. But it doesnt deliver them in the end.My cheaper blackberry was more reliable than it so I went back to it.All other things apart... watch out for the camera people. you buy a 12 MP camera phone and if you can\'t get the pictures, its just not worth it, you would rather have a better user experience.'),(72,'B003ZX7RL4','...:::HARDWARE:::...Pro:1. Very sturdy and robust build. Dropped 2x on hard floors and still unscathed.2. Feels natural in the palm of my hand.3. Gorilla glass is tough and scratch resistant enough that you do not need any screen protector.4. Anodized aluminum body casing resists normal wear and tear and can withstand heat. No need to purchase a protective case.5. 12MP Camera hands-down is the best camera phone in the world right now. Beautiful, crisp, and full of details can be taken with various built-in scene-mode such as landscape, night mode, sport, up-close, and even Panorama...)Cons:1. Home button is located all the way at the bottom left corner of the device. I dropped my phone for the first time when I tried to hold my phone (left hand) and pressed the button one-handed.2. Battery is non-removable. But you can still unscrew the two allen screws on the side of the phone if you ever need to replace the battery. However, according to Nokia, doing so by yourself will void their warranty....:::SOFTWARE:::...Here I want to point out that the version that comes with this phone out of the box is Symbian^3. Whereas, the latest update out there as of 2/11/2012 is Symbian Belle. If you haven\'t updated to Belle already, I recommend doing so ASAP because this is a HUGE software improvement over Symbian^3 where Nokia branded phones were mostly being complained at.From here on out... my review is based on Belle.First off, Belle is BEAUTIFUL! Putting Belle side by side with an Android and iOS device and Belle stands out clearly in terms of color vibrant and icons sorting styles.:Responsiveness:Belle is VERY fast as compared to her sister Anna and Symbian^3. Kinetic scrolling has been improved where scrolling feels a lot more natural and fluid.:Drop/Pull down bar:Swiping the phone from top edge down will pull down the notifications bar with 4 most used buttons: Mobile Data On/Off, Wi-fi On/Off, Bluetooth On/Off, and Silent Mode. Below are your miss call event notifications, active apps, and current data usage. Just like Android\'s drop down bar, but looks a lot neater and easier to the eye.:Widgets:This is the sweet spot of Symbian OS.Email, Maps Location (ver 3.09), and Facebook (ver 1.5) widgets are speechlessly beautiful. Update constantly right on the home screen. So useful to glance at them for a quick moment without the need to open up the app itself.:Battery:Lasted me the whole day from 7:30 AM to 10:30 PM in a single charge, with heavy usage of music playing (aux connection with my car speaker while driving). Medium usage of browsing Facebook and Nokia Store during my lunch/break time at school and at work. My brightness setting is set to Medium-High. Yet the phone survived the entire day without even hitting the 10% mark at night.:GPS/Navigation/Driving Experience:How do you Call + GPS + Music almost at the same time while driving? If you haven\'t done so already, download Nokia Carmode from the Nokia Store. Under this mode, EVERYTHING is simplified into 3 most used functions while driving: Call + GPS + Music. 3 huge buttons are on the screen for easy one tap accessing to reduce distraction to the driver.:Social Apps:The new updated Facebook version (1.5) now comes with Notification. A huge improvement from previous version that came with Anna. The self-updating/self-rotating home screen widget is now improved with a larger display and crisper looking. This large display takes half of a home screen now display 10 top recent news feed from Facebook with the scrolling capability for the user to view at their will. The bottom, right after the 10th news feed would now be the Refresh button.Version 1.5 did not come together with Belle update. You have to manually search for \"Social Networking Client\" in the Nokia Store and download it to update yourself.With Belle, i am now very proud of my N8. No longer afraid to show it off in front of my Android friends. Nokia has won my trust back.'),(73,'B003ZX7RL4','I did receive my Nokia N8 a week ago and I have been using it in all kind of manners from 05:30 in the morning to 23:00 at night. It is definitely the best Nokia I have ever used. It is extremely well built, for a release software it is also very good with very few bugs. The GPS connects inside my house in seconds. Bluetooth connects to my car stereo for handsfree calling in a few seconds. I make it from 05:30 to 22:00 without charging with a couple of hours listening to music in headphones, an hour of web browsing, an hour of listening to podcasts streamed through the FM transmitter to my car stereo.The reason I don\'t give it 5 stars is that the web browser although better than on the 5800 and the X6 is not as good as Android or iPhone (I have an iPod) and the music player is not as good as on the 5800 or the X6. I have not found a way to tag albums using pictures on the phone or change the name of songs on the phone the way I was able to do on the N86, the 5800 and the X6.After Nokia changed the way they deal with developers with regards to cost of publishing apps and the developer tools there have already been quite a lot of new apps coming for this phone like Angry Birds etc.There is a new web browser plus lots of other goodies coming in a future fw and then this phone will be worth 5 out of 5 stars.Did I mention that the camera is by far the best on any mobile device and the design is also very attractive.The videos and the pictures you can take with this phone are just astonishing. Check youtube for some short films shot with this phone.I bought this phone at buy dot com for 430 using amazon check out. I am surprised that Amazon still sells this phone for 549.'),(74,'B003ZX7RL4','This phones main selling point is it\'s camera - it can take 16 x 9 photos (9 Megapixel), and can take full 12 megapixel camera that can take full resolution photos in 4:3 format. The phone integrates very well with windows. Nokia\'s complimentary windows app \"Nokia Suite\" allows contact editing through desktop. It also allows sending text messages through desktop (when phone is connected). \"Nokia Suite\" makes tethering very easy, and you can use internet both from phone and desktop.Nokia also includes inbuild GPS with voice navigation, and world maps are included standard. Voice guidance is available in many languages from around the world, or, if you like, you can make your own voice navigation.Nokia\'s battery lasted a bit longer when I first had it. These days it lasts about 18 hrs with an average of 3 hrs of talk time during day, and about 50-75 text messaging.The reason I have to give Nokia a 3 star is because of its recent software update Belle. This update is in all due honesty a cheap knockoff of Android. So, if you can avoid getting Belle on Nokia, it is worth 4 star atleast.Compared to what iphone offers OOTB, Nokia definitely is a strong contender.'),(75,'B003ZX7RL4','Well, I replaced my trusty old N95, because it was finally breaking down, and just out of curiosity decided to see what Nokia is up to since then (having skipped the N97), and it\'s an unfortunate story of could have been.This is a great phone in the making, which would be OK if this came from a start-up, the kind of thing that might make you decide to buy their next phone, but it\'s not good enough from Nokia. Several firmware updates later (by 6/18/2011), I guess there\'s no hope that this phone will ever really work, and I\'m giving up.The features in general are great, the design oozes quality, but overall the phone is way too buggy. It spontaneously reboots when I delete five contacts, when I page through my pictures for too long, when I try to navigate by the GPS, and it reboots unpredictably in all kinds of other odd conditions. All in all, it freezes up about 5-10 times a day and goes into a reboot. So this is not even Nokia\'s Windows Vista, this is all the way back to Windows 95, which was buggy as hell, so I can\'t wait for the next service update of Symbian^3. After 6 months of use I rate it a 2 on a scale from 1-5 and I\'ve switched to a Motorola Atrix - and I\'ve accomplished more convenience in 2-3 hours of setup time, than in six months of wrestling with the N8. This is the ignominious end of a wonderful company, and I cannot imagine how you could turn this mess around.'),(76,'B003ZX7RL4','I had this phone for over a month and I am quite happy I got it. It works great on T Mobile service. Why get this phone instead of others? I did not want to be tied to a service that had limited data plan and T Mobile had unlimited data plan that was very reasonable in price. Since iPhone4 does not work well with T Mobile, that cut the choices to a few.I had prior experiences with Nokia phones and how bullet proof was and I so I went with this one especially when it showed up during Christmas\' Lightning Deals. Nokia makes great hardware but software could be their weak spot. This phone is already over year old and that means the Symbian OS for this phone will have most of the bugs out. I was an early adopter for the N900 and that is the lesson I learned. There are many annoyances and aggravations if you are an early adopter. I will make some comparison between this N8 and N900 that I had for 2 years.I am an amateur photographer and love snapping pictures and having a good camera was a must. The N8 filled that bill. I know that 12 megapixels for a small lens was overkill but boy do the pictures come out good! The HD videos from this phone is beyond impressive. I took night videos of Christmas light and they came out crisp and sharp. Photographing at night still is limited and shows high noise and that is not a surprise given the small lens diameter. The larger diameter lens you have, the better light gathering capability you have. That is why DSLR is the best camera to have if you want to take pictures in the dark with no flash (and a very steady hand or tripod! and a very fast lens!). The N8 comes with Zeiss Tessar lens with 2.8 aperture and that gives you the edge on pictures taking that other smartphone camera will fail. There has been a feature film shown in movie theater that had been shot totally with the Nokia N8. Albeit done with a Canon lens in front of it with adapters that seem to be custom made. I have Canon lens and looking for adapters for it myself!! The N900 had a great camera cover that one manually opened to use the camera and kept the lens clean. The N8 is exposed and therefore got dirty. I was looking into a protective film and read that it was not a good idea. So I have to clean that front lens quite frequently when taking pictures. There are several apps available for camera and I do like one app that can morph and do funny things to the photo while taking it. I had lots of fun with my friends that way. The N8 own camera app had good integration with Facebook and I was able to share easily with my friends and they are amazed how the pictures look. HD video is not easy to share if it is more than certain size for obvious reason.The main purpose of a phone is able to make phone calls, right? In this way this phone excels. The speakerphone is clear and sharp and very loud (necessary for me as I have hearing impairment). I do not like holding phone next to my ear because I get radiation burn on my skin where the phone was. The ability to make phone call is easy on this phone. One could set up one touch dial to call a frequently called number or even do speech command.Emails on this phone is great. I was able to set up Google and Yahoo quite easily. On N900 I could not get Yahoo has I did not have POP Yahoo mail (that was for an extra fee for Yahoo POP Mail). For some reason on the N8 I could set up Yahoo which is great! The N8 also gives you options for other emails like Hotmail etc. The emails were very readable and the new Anna update made emails even better by highlighting the ones not read yet. For entering text, I do miss the physical keyboard of the N900 but the screen keyboard using Swype is just great. Swype I heard is available on Android too.Screen: The screen is very readable and pretty responsible to touch. Occasionally I have noted some freeze up and I had to shut if off and restart. It seems to be happening less often the more I use it. I try to be very careful which app I am going to add to prevent issues. This Nokia N8 has the same chip as the older N900 (which is more than 2 yrs old) but I find it is FASTER and more responsive than the older N900. Which shows you the effect of a lean and mean OS has on the usability of the product. The older N900 had higher screen resolution than the N8 and yet the N8 seems to be brighter and more readable. The N8 screen was difficult to see in sunlight while N900 was easy to read. So this is a step backward.Battery life is excellent! Can run whole day and charge it at night. Nice thing is that it has two ways to charge it. Via the microUSB or the Nokia proprietary jack that was previously used in old Nokia cell phones. Nice thing is if you are using the microUSB for something like hooking up with an external hard drive or for a keyboard, you can still charge it.Why 4 stars instead of 5? Like I said, the software sometimes freezes and I have to do a hard shutdown.ADDENDUM Feb-2012: Nokia upgraded the N8 Symbian software to the Belle and I did upgrade to it and it is like getting a new phone!! I love how easy it is to shut off the Bluetooth and WIFI to lengthen the battery life when you do not need it. The phone is so much fun to use!! I had been taking lots of pictures with it and the night time shots without flash is just amazing!! The Belle also upgraded the desktop to six different ones that you can put your own shortcuts and widgets. The email app is excellent. The Facebook app is also excellent and very usable. The Swype method typing is just great and it makes my texting so much easier so that I do not miss the tactile keyboard that I thought I would miss. Battery life is still excellent. Way better than any smartphones I had used. One still needs to charge every night to make sure you do not have a dead phone next day. The Belle upgrade also upgraded the camera app and it is so good that I do not feel I need another app for taking pictures.Addendum March-2012: I had experienced some freezing issues when I was editing pictures that I had taken with the cell phone camera. It was simply solved by using the main power button and holding it until it shuts off then restarting again. The photo app comes with editing suite that includes adding bubble text, graphics and changing contrast settings and so forth. So you can do some few Photoshop type tricks on your cell phone pictures. I just love this feature of this camera phone! I think for around three hundred dollars and a few change, you get one of the best pocketable camera with video plus one of the best GPS with voice instructions with free updated maps for MOST countries in the world for no extra charge, plus phone that actually works great and a much better bluetooth implementation. The bluetooth is so sensitive that I was able to be in a restaurant and the bluetooth speaker in the car parked in the lot still was able to be in contact with my phone. Of course this is not what you want but it demonstrates the sensitivity of bluetooth for this phone that was not there in many other phones.'),(77,'B003ZX7RL4','After reviewing the newests options such as Iphone, Blackberry, Android. I went for the N8. I can confirm that it was the best decision. It does everything I expected to do.Yes it is not as \"friendly\" as an Iphone, but the capabilities , versatility and functionality are way better than the Iphone.Having owned and still have a Blackberry and an Iphone, The N8 is my preferred choice.* Easy access to email accounts* Excellent access to Facebook and Twitter* Maps for Free...* Excellent Camera and Video* Plays almost any video format* Very Good Apps, maybe not as flashy as the Iphone but they do what is neededSo far I have not found any negatives'),(78,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'m using this product by two years and I never have had problems with it. It\'s small, fast, elegant and very useful. Despite it doesn\'t have a commercial OS, not significate you won\'t have thousands of applications. Nokia has been taking care of they users until now by giving the last applications in the Ovi Store. Also, software developers haven\'t forgotten os symbian users. The price is good for all the wonderful things that Nokia N8 does. In summary, I strongly recommend this cell phone to every one who wants to have a very good experience with a low price.'),(79,'B003ZX7RL4','i was skeptical at first Cuz so many ppl saying there\'s alot of problems with this phone but I\'ve owned it for over 4 month now and I\'ve had very few problems that a simple restart fixed, and after trying ios i found the N8 to to be more customizable and nice looking os and also the camera has been better than any phone I\'ve seen (possibly close to some digital). With all the new updates from nokia this has just gotten better and compared to other phones n other areas there isn\'t as many apps in the app store bu i\'ve found everything thats important as far as apps and it can be a bit slow at times compared to new phones from 2012 but the phone does hold up pretty well against the competition considering the phone is two years older and half the price as most new high end phones and also this phone does alot out of the box that on other os you\' have to download apps.Overall this is a good phone for the price,p.s. I am currently using the phone to type this review.'),(80,'B003ZX7RL4','Well, I have used a lot of Nokia phones, and my current one, the E51 is awesome, still! I have big expectations from my phone, not in terms of apps etc, but in terms of reliability. I want something that is small, yet powerful, not a computer, but enough to get the essentials done. The E51, 4 years ago, was epic! It still is awesome, given its size, it is quite a useful device.Now coming to the N8, i read about it, and it seemed nice. I was hesitant about it since Nokia has backed out from Symbian, and the N9 is twice the price of the N8. But given the hardware specs, i decided to go along with it.----It has a 12MP/Carl Zeiss Optics camera, which is very good. It has a FM transmitter which is very rare these days. It has the other usual features you\'d expect from a smartphone, though i do not expect as many apps as I would for an android/iphone. But i would say, at the price (290), it is a good deal if you like an unlocked phone.----The reason why i gave this phone the rating i have is this : I took the regular SIM card out of my E51, and pushed it into the N8. It worked, YAY! But as a sanity check, i wanted to put it back in the E51, and that was when it stuck me... the SIM card would not come out. Now i have taken the SIM card in and out of my E51 gazillions of times, so either the E51 was a defective design or the N8 is. I am going to return the phone with my SIM card in it (deactivated and erased) since I do not want to damage it and void the warranty. But its going to cost me to get a replacement SIM.----Just some Nokia bashing while I am at it. WHY??? Nokia used to be so reliable, what happened? I had a 3510i, a 6610i, E51, n810 and C6-01. These were/are awesome. I had a previous confrontation with Nokia when i ordered a n910 as a bargain on their website. They charged me twice, and then just didn\'t honor the order. I guess Nokia isn\'t the brand it used to be... and i am not going to stick with them... so no Nokia/Windows phones for me.... probably go with Android!'),(81,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ve bought one N8 because of the stunning hardware. Big mistake. After using it for 3 weeks, it discharged and never worked again. After some search in the internet  i found that is a very common issue on this telephone ( google \'n8 dying\' ). Service is not good as well. Several users reported sending the telephones back to nokia several times to tesolve the issue. Mine case is even worse, because i bougth the telkephone in a different contry from which i live in and the official service told me that i have to bougth a new phone because this issue cannot be repaired (or to repair is the same cost as to buy a new phone). So in brief, don\'t be fooled by the phone specs and go for an iphone or htc.'),(82,'B003ZX7RL4','I purchased this phone earlier this year and love all the features it has.June 25 2012 I went on a fishing outing with this phone in my wrist pouch.i took a picture of my sons first of seven fish he caught,when my phone fell out of the pouch and rolled down the bank into the water.I hurried to pull it out of the water took the battery out to let the water drain out.I thought that I was going to have to purchase a new phone,but to my surprise the phone came back on the following week working.It rebooted several times,but now it works fine with no problems.Only problem is the battery needs replaced now because the charge only last 10 hours.'),(83,'B003ZX7RL4','I am a self confessed gadget freak. After using the xperia X10 and Iphone4 in the past few months, I purchased the N8 yesterday. The up\'s and down\'s in my opinion, are as follows:1- The N8 UI is as crude as Android. The Iphone 4 wins by miles in this category.2- If you have used Nokia before, the N8 requires very little learning compared to Android and iOS4.3- The iPhone4 screen resolution is the best on any smart phone.4- The iPhone is not the most stylish phone. N8 is disappointing to look at. The best looking of the current crop of smart phones is Android based Sony Ericsson Xperia x10.5- The Xperia x10 has the best battery life.6- The N8 has the best camera of all smart phones ever made.7- The N8 has the most user friendly Bluetooth and Wireless functionality.8- The N8 has the best integration with Outlook. Android and iOS lack flexibility.9- The N8 offers largest storage space of any smart phone if an optional 32gb microSd card is purchased. It costs between 89-110 dollars.10- For a game freak, nothing beats Iphone 4.f you want style over functionality, buy the iPhone 4. If you want to try out Android, go for Xperia X10. If you want a great camera and business integration, the N8 cant be beat.'),(84,'B003ZX7RL4','This is an amazing phone!!! I upgraded from Sony Ericsson Satio to this Nokia N8, and it has been a truly remarkable experience for me. The Symbian^3 operating system is amazing; much simpler to use and more intuitive than Android or iPhone OS; you don\'t have to be a computer scientist or scroll through oceans of icons to get what you want!! I love the numerous homescreen widgets and the ability to customize the homescreens in any way you like! There are three homescreens by default, but they can be raised to six through a very simple process. Email setup is remarkably easy and straight-forward. The camera is so powerful and high quality; it\'s even better than Satio!! 12MP/300dpi is only possible on this phone!! You will never need a digital camera anymore!! The original resolution level of the phone can be further increased through a very simple process enabling it to take even better pictures. The multimedia power is amazing. Very nice audio and video quality. The battery life is remarkably long. I have four push emails all the time and I use the phone a lot, and the battery charge lasts for at least two full days, and often even longer. Also this phone gets updates almost every week, which is a great plus!! You get more and more apps and widgets all the time. The Symbian Belle (Symbian^4) update is just around the corner, and that will make this phone even more amazing; I can\'t wait for this update. I truely recommend this phone to everybody!! You won\'t need any other gadget if you have this phone. It\'s the only true all-in-one gadget that you can find!!! Great job Nokia!!!The GPS navigation software on this phone helped me achieve one of the most challenging experiences in my life! I drove down the mountain from Lake Arrowhead in extremely heavy fog and rainstorm!!! I could barely see anything in front of me!! I only relied on the Nokia Ovi Maps Drive Navigation on my N8!! I drove almost blindly just by relying on the commands from my N8, which guided me through the labyrinth of Lake Arrowhead streets and down the highway with extraordinary accuracy!! I am so proud of my Nokia N8!! Thank you Nokia for the N8 and for the maps/navigation software!!!The built-in FM transmitter in N8 is phenomenal!! I no longer have to carry a connector with me to listen to my music in the car.Just take a look at the full specs of the phone on Wikipedia, and you will be amazed of its capabilities. It\'s really got the whole package. I can\'t think of any other phone with better overall specs and features.'),(85,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this phone with high expectations and it is huge disappointment.  My Nokia E71 has never let me down and I am a huge Nokia supporter.1) The touch screen constantly picks the wrong numbers or letters you type even with software update 1.2 installed on the phone.  If you have small fingers then this is not as much of an issue.  You have to hit the touch screen perfectly to get the correct letter on number that you selected. Very frustrating. Emails and texting are almost impossible on this phone.  To many errors with keystrokes.  When you try to reply to a email you have to touch the area in the email where your reply goes to start typing.  But the problem is that sometimes the phone will not open the window for you to type the reply message in.  You have to hit the typing area more than one time for the phone to get into reply mode for an email.  This is in inexcusable problem for a smartphone.  The are no touch screen settings to fix this issue.2) When you make a call and you have to use the touchscreen for touch tone input for a phone systems automated attendant menu prompt, 99% of business calls today will require touch tone input, the phone will dial a number in the contacts list instead of just inputting the touch tones as any normal phone would do.  It searches the contacts as you type the digits, and about 50% of the time it will call the number related to the keys that you just imputed instead off just entering the keystrokes tones for the automated attendant prompts.3) You can not run more than one email account at a time on this phone with out severely effecting the phones performance.  If you run a pop account and a Exchange account on the default home screen.  The phone becomes so unresponsive it bogs down to anything you try and do from that point on.4) The signal reception on this phone is terrible compared to my Nokia E71.  It will go from a full signal to 1 or 2 bars for no reason at all.  Once again my Nokia E71 does not have this problem.5) If the signal gets really bad the phone will switch from 3G to Edge and then the phone will not switch back to 3G when you are in an area that supports it.  You have to reboot the phone to get it back into 3G mode.  This is a major issue when you are in an area with varying terrain. Once again my E71 does not do this either.6) I had the first phone\'s camera go bad.  The camera would take pictures and the image was all white and saturated like a fog white color.  No adjustment or a full camera reset on the phone fixed the problem, face recognition was off, auto white balance set to auto or manual did not help.  Set the flash to off and changed the exposure iris level and this helped a little but still white haze on all photo\'s.  This happened on a the second phone\'s camera that Amazon sent me and this phone was made in China and more buggy than the first one made in Finland.  Definitely a issue with this camera.7) The phone has to be checked for open applications to perform correctly.  Any unnecessary open apps kill this phones performance.8) You constantly hit the camera button on the side of the phone when you are making a phone call.  It is almost impossible not to hit this button by mistake and turn the camera feature on.MY first phone was made in Finland the Rma\'ed phone that Amazon sent me was built in China.  The second phone was more buggy than the first with the sensors on the phone.  I had to switch them all off.For a $500 phone I was expecting way more from Nokia.  This phone is a huge disappointment and I sent them both back to Amazon for a full refund.Buyer beware if you are a power user and demand more from a phone you should look elsewhere.There are to many negatives that out way the positives of this phone.'),(86,'B003ZX7RL4','It is a very good phone with many features in it. I just love the HDMI connectivity to the TV....so just coz of this feature I need not connect my laptop to the TV and watch a movie if I want to. It\'s 12 MP camera is also amazing....dude 12MP cam means u dnt need a point n shoot camera if u r out. It also turns into a 3G WiFi hotspot which is also amazing. There are a few flaws in the OS that the phone restarts automatically sometimes, sometimes the sensors get turned off automatically so the screen stops rotating. But I mean if you are ok with such small things the it is a very good phone. A person who is anti iPhone, it is a very good choice for him.I have had some issues with Nokia N8 and amazon.com gave me a replacement and its perfectly fine....I am very happy with it. I can say that Nokia N8 is a first Nokia phone that i liked so much.'),(87,'B003ZX7RL4','After the unmitigated disaster that was the Nokia N97, the N8 gives Nokia one last true effort at redemption. For a company that was initially the world leader in mobile phone sales, having nearly twice the market share as its nearest competitor, Nokia has fallen way behind indeed as the leading technology innovator, in recent years. It\'s really all due to poor leadership. It began with copying all the bad habits of competitors (like placing loudspeaker grills at the backs instead of infront or at the sides of phones), and abandoning first principles (like no longer making products user friendly/very easy to use.) With the N8, the company is attempting to reclaim lost glory, and ground.Having literally thrown the N97 in the garbage a few times, I can honestly state that using the N8 is a vaaaaaaaaaaslty better experience. Although the software continues to be more complicated to use at times than it really ought to be, there is far more to like about the phone than dislike.For one, the software is a lot more stable, though not rock solid. There are still occasional bugs that annoy - try marking all text messages in a folder and scrolling, and the phone will freeze for a a minute or two before finally flinging the list of texts across the screen. When responding to a text in conversation mode, you literally have to hard \"tap\" the input area for the phone to respond. A light press of the finger won\'t do. In portrait mode, sometimes touching a symbol like a question mark or exclamation point for a text message, requires two or three presses, and almost never works with a thumb. An index or other finger is definitely preferred.Overall though, the capacitive touch experience is nearly on par with that of the Iphone, the screen is bright, everything on the phone works as it\'s supposed to, and all the programs installed are much more accessible than before. A particularly happy highlight is the process for setting up email accounts - a more straightforward process I do not know of.But perhaps the real genius of this phone are its photo and video abilities. I can\'t tell you the difference between HD and otherD, blue ray or dvd, but I can recognize a good photo when I see one or good video when I watch it. The phone\'s camera is so good you\'ll not only want to take more and more pictures, but it will make you believe you\'re actually a pretty decent photographer. It\'s just that good. The videos look like they were shot by a hollywood studio with a large production budget, and are *crystal* *clear!!!*Of course, with all that good stuff, those wonderful people at Nokia had to find *something* to screw up - the phone has only one loudspeaker port located on the back of the handset right next to the camera lens, on the protruding camera module...(eyes rolling.) The problem is that, because of its location, if you place the phone face up on a desk, table or other flat surface, the loudspeaker is automatically muffled to the point of uselessness.... And, if you just happen to lay the phone down on its back on something soft, like a couch, easy chair or bed, YOU CAN\'T HEAR ANY SOUND. Not phone calls, text messages, email notificaions. Nothing. Yes. I know it\'s hard to believe but, the people at Nokia really are.that.stupid.You can\'t make perfection the enemy of the good so... it\'s still a great phone and one of Nokias best in a long, looooooong time, and I should know. I\'ve only bought Nokias in the last 12 years.'),(88,'B003ZX7RL4','I like this phone. I never liked touch screen phones and this phone seems to have the same issue of poor responsiveness as other nokia phones. I mean, unless your screen is PERFECTLY clean it won\'t work 100%. Also, you can\'t access your apps unless you login to your ovi account which is inconvenient, or maybe I just can\'t figure it out...I don\'t know. I like the wi-fi, never tried the gps, the music player is great, couldn\'t open attachments in my gmail with this phone. Not much of tv app variety, I have been watching al-jazeerah news tho they broadcast a lot of news you will never hear on american tv. I haven\'t even figured out 25% of this phone yet but I already like it.'),(89,'B003ZX7RL4','2012 UPDATE: Have now had the phone over a year & do not regret the purchase at all.  The Symbian Anna/Belle updates fixed the purple screen issue.  The N8 still works great: long battery life, good reception, excellent camera ... the only downside is that with Symbian on death row for 2016, the # of new apps are dwindling, so if having the latest is an issue for you, you may want to pass.  On the flip side, the price is now $100 less that what I paid making this an incredible deal for those who do not want to pay for a data plan.  The cheapest one is $20/mo so when the 2 year contract is up, you have pretty much made the $ back on the cost of phone.  Now that Nokia is switching over to Windows, which US carriers can detect & force you into a data plan, I would not hesitate to buy this phone if wifi is all you need.I have now had the phone all of 3 days when I noticed that I have the purple screen/tint issue that people have been complaining about since the N8\'s launch (search the web for details).  It was most notable on the unlock screen - half the clock was purple while the other half was black.  Altho the clock on the screensaver does not have this issue.Amazon\'s Help Section was anything but, as their directions on how to EXCHANGE sends you to the RETURN section, where exchanges are not an option.  I called & Amazon will be sending a replacement; the good news is, I do not have to return my phone immediately.  I can wait till the new N8 arrives, that way I am not phoneless.Otherwise, the N8 is great; I intended to use it more before I wrote a review but wanted to warn people that the purple issue still exists before they buy.  Some quick points: the Symbian OS is like the step-child of the mobile world but for me, & I suspect many, it works & does what it needs to do.  The build quality is superb & the phone is slimmer than I thought it would be.  So far no problems w/ the phone rebooting randomly (another common complaint).  Battery life is excellent.The reason I got this phone is bc I did not want to be forced into a data plan & so far this phone has worked great on just wi-fi.  Keep in mind that Nokia just said that they will soon stop selling unlocked phones so anyone else wanting to not be trapped into a data plan may want to buy soon.Hopefully the next phone has no issues & ships w/ Symbian Anna & not ^3 (crosses fingers). Then I will write another review or update this one w/ more details ...UPDATE: Just got the replacement phone & still the purple screen issue.  Grrrr ... !Amazon will not exchange the phone twice, they are now only offering a refund.  They got a Nokia rep on the phone with us who offered to have it fixed under warranty but that would leave me phoneless in the week or so that would take.  Neither is exactly an ideal situation (I would like to keep exchanging this brand new expensive phone until I got one that worked properly) but to Amazon\'s credit, they did put \"Item Under Review\" on the dark gray N8 & are not selling it at all until they have a look at it ...UPDATE 2: 6 months later & now on the Belle OS update.  The phone works just fine - does what it supposed to do.  The Anna update took away the purple tint & it is still gone.  AT&T; still has not forced me into a data plan. Do not regret purchasing this phone & recommend to anyone looking for a basic smartphone or dares to be different, especially now that it is $60 less than what I paid.'),(90,'B003ZX7RL4','I attempted to replace my wife\'s Nokia N8 that has started having issues with connecting to WiFi and randomly powering off. She received the product and performed the phone switch and updates via Nokia suite. To her surprise the new phone performed worse than the one that was replaced. It would cut off on her mid call, wouldn\'t connect to the WiFi, and lock up making the unit inoperable. Maybe this was a defective unit, but being that her other N8 had issues was sent in for a warranty repair under a year. I doubt it. I hope everyone else has better luck with this unit, but I will not be purchasing another N8.'),(91,'B003ZX7RL4','Step right up, step right up, step right up,Everyone\'s a winner, bargains galoreThat\'s right, you too can be the proud ownerOf the quality goes in before the name goes onOne-tenth of a dollar, one-tenth of a dollar, we got service after salesYou need perfume? we got perfume, how \'bout an engagement ring?Something for the little lady, something for the little lady,Something for the little lady, hmmThree for a dollarWe got a year-end clearance, we got a white saleAnd a smoke-damaged furniture, you can drive it away todayAct now, act now, and receive as our gift, our gift to youThey come in all colors, one size fits allNo muss, no fuss, no spills, you\'re tired of kitchen drudgeryEverything must go, going out of business, going out of businessGoing out of business saleFifty percent off original retail price, skip the middle manDon\'t settle for lessHow do we do it? how do we do it? volume, volume, turn up the volumeNow you\'ve heard it advertised, don\'t hesitateDon\'t be caught with your drawers down,Don\'t be caught with your drawers downYou can step right up, step right upThat\'s right, it filets, it chops, it dices, slices,Never stops, lasts a lifetime, mows your lawnAnd it mows your lawn and it picks up the kids from schoolIt gets rid of unwanted facial hair, it gets rid of embarrassing age spots,It delivers a pizza, and it lengthens, and it strengthensAnd it finds that slipper that\'s been at largeunder the chaise lounge for several weeksAnd it plays a mean Rhythm Master,It makes excuses for unwanted lipstick on your collarAnd it\'s only a dollar, step right up, it\'s only a dollar, step right up\'Cause it forges your signatureIf not completely satisfied, mail back unused portion of productFor complete refund of price of purchaseStep right upPlease allow thirty days for delivery, don\'t be fooled by cheap imitationsYou can live in it, live in it, laugh in it, love in itSwim in it, sleep in it,Live in it, swim in it, laugh in it, love in itRemoves embarrassing stains from contour sheets, that\'s rightAnd it entertains visiting relatives, it turns a sandwich into a banquetTired of being the life of the party?Change your shorts, change your life, change your lifeChange into a nine-year-old Hindu boy, get rid of your wife,And it walks your dog, and it doubles on saxDoubles on sax, you can jump back Jack, see you later alligatorSee you later alligatorAnd it steals your carIt gets rid of your gambling debts, it quits smokingIt\'s a friend, and it\'s a companion,And it\'s the only product you will ever needFollow these easy assembly instructions it never needs ironingWell it takes weights off hips, bust, thighs, chin, midriff,Gives you dandruff, and it finds you a job, it is a jobAnd it strips the phone company free take ten for five exchange,And it gives you denture breathAnd you know it\'s a friend, and it\'s a companionAnd it gets rid of your traveler\'s checksIt\'s new, it\'s improved, it\'s old-fashionedWell it takes care of business, never needs winding,Never needs winding, never needs windingGets rid of blackheads, the heartbreak of psoriasis,Christ, you don\'t know the meaning of heartbreak, buddy,C\'mon, c\'mon, c\'mon, c\'mon\'Cause it\'s effective, it\'s defective, it creates household odors,It disinfects, it sanitizes for your protectionIt gives you an erection, it wins the electionWhy put up with painful corns any longer?It\'s a redeemable coupon, no obligation, no salesman will visit your homeWe got a jackpot, jackpot, jackpot, prizes, prizes, prizes, all work guaranteedHow do we do it, how do we do it, how do we do it, how do we do itWe need your business, we\'re going out of businessWe\'ll give you the businessGet on the business end of our going-out-of-business saleReceive our free brochure, free brochureRead the easy-to-follow assembly instructions, batteries not includedSend before midnight tomorrow, terms available,Step right up, step right up, step right upYou got it buddy: the large print giveth, and the small print taketh awayStep right up, you can step right up, you can step right upC\'mon step right up(Get away from me kid, you bother me...)Step right up, step right up, step right up, c\'mon, c\'mon, c\'mon, c\'mon, c\'monStep right up, you can step right up, c\'mon and step right up,C\'mon and step right up'),(92,'B003ZX7RL4','This is a device that requires a lot of time and energy to master. However, if your requirement is to have the capability to capture high quality images for a modest price then the Nokia N8-00 is worth considering. The user interface is not as easy to understand as iOS or even Android. The number of apps numbers in the tens of thousands.  That means there are only several hundred apps that will interest you. Basically to be happy with this handset you\'ll want the camera to the exclusion of all other capabilities.  It\'s a handset for those who can\'t or won\'t be locked into the Apple, Google, or Microsoft ecosystems.Consider that intro as my warning of \"here be monsters.\" If you are adventurous then continue on:In the box you\'ll find a Nokia N8-00 and all the trimmings. That is to say a charger, HDMI output cable, and USB cable. And the usual safety manuals.  The Nokia N8-00 ships with Symbian^3, a 2010-era operating system with a tough interface to master and memory management problems. The only good thing about Symbian^3 is you can get rid of it.To get rid of Symbian^3 you\'ll need a desktop PC or laptop running Windows XP or 7, a really high speed data connection, and the latest copy of Nokia Suite (available from Nokia). Plan to download about 1 GB of data in 300 MB chunks.  Before starting your upgrade adventure, spend several hours reading the information regarding the N8-00 at [...]. You\'ll also have to create a Nokia account to download maps and apps. Going from Symbian^3 to Nokia Belle takes about 6-10 hours of tinkering.After installing Nokia Suite, connect the handset to the computer and let the two devices get to know each other. When the drivers are synced up you can start the software upgrade process. Nokia Suite will offer to upgrade the software from Symbian^3 to Symbian Anna. After that is completed, the next upgrade is to Nokia Belle. During the upgrade to Nokia Belle you\'ll see warnings forbidding you from touching the handset. Heed that warning!Getting the handset to Nokia Belle is simultaneously the beginning and end of the journey. Click on SWUpdate and download whatever remaining apps and widgets Nokia thinks you are entitled to possess on your handset. And be sure to visit the Nokia store to pick up additional apps published by Nokia (e.g. \"Internet radio\").Nokia more or less abandoned Symbian/Nokia Belle in February 2011. From a user perspective this means the bugs in the handset\'s firmware are here to stay. You\'ll have to live with the bugs and quirks and work with them or around them. At one time Symbian was the most popular smartphone OS in the world. It was also the most targeted for malware. That software is still out there. You can operate the handset without an antivirus solution but depending upon your use case that might not be an acceptable mode of operation. Fortunately, anti-malware solutions are still available and maintained by their vendors.So why would anyone buy this handset in 2013? Well, besides the camera\'s unusual capabilities the handset can be used as a SIP phone to make VOIP calls, Nokia provides free software to listen to radio stations that stream on the Internet, the N8-00 has an FM radio, Bluetooth, and can play music via your vehicle\'s FM transmitter. Or, your hotel\'s FM radio. The HMDI output allows you to play 720p video on a television. Replacing the battery is a trivial operation.  Repairs cost about $100, so after a year if something goes wrong an out-of-warranty repair is relatively expensive. Finally, this is one of the handsets that implemented USB On-The-Go.In the end the camera is going to make or break this handset\'s experience for you.

The negative reviews I\'ve seen seem to come mostly either from people who are expecting an IPhone clone ( it just works ) or from people who don\'t know the Symbian ^3 OS .First , I should state that I\'m not familiar with the IPhone, never used it , but I am familiar with Android ( MyTouch 3G Slide , G2 ) and RIM ( Blackberry Curve 8900 ) , but most of my smartphones have been Windows Mobile ( T-Mobile Dash , T-Mobile Dash 3G , HD2 ) , which may account for why Symbian ^3 seems so familiar and why I have no problem wth the occassional reboot . Now for the features ...Many people have dissed the N8 for the Symbian^3 UI  being clunky , which it is a bit . But I have no problem with it as it is very useful . As Rita El Khoury ( Google it ) put in an article , which I suggest you read  , \" Really there\'s nothing you can\'t do with Symbian once you know the drill . \" In this way , Symbian ^3 is very similar to WM .Reviewers have also slammed the Nokia browser too . It could use some improvement , but it\'s pretty good as is . It\'s a bit slower than the Google browser , though not much slower , and it does a good job with Flash , especially considering that the N8 has only FlashLite 4.1 . The rendering of pages could be better , though , and it really needs Flash 10.1 .Another sore point with reviewers is the keyboard , and they do have a few points here . The landscape QWERTY does have a rather odd key layout which does take some getting used to . Once used to it though , I find it to be a superior virtual KB . As to the the alphanumeric  portrait keyboard , I think Nokia needs to have a QWERTY option here ( Nokia , you need to take a hard look at the Opera Mobile 10.1 portrait QWERTY ; it\'s great !) . That said , there are situations ( logging in , for instance ) where the alphanumeric kb is useful .Camera on the N8 is terrific , no complaints ! Also love the video recording !  Not to forget that this is a superb multimedia device , great video and audio codec support ! Also love the  HDMI , though haven\'t used it lol , and the 3.5 mm AV port .Design on the N8 is first rate ! My only complaint here is that the battery is difficult to remove , but being able to disconnect the battery by an 8  second press on the power button does help . I like being able to access the SIM and micro SD cards from outside the phone , not to mention the hardware lock and camera buttons , fantastic ! Nor have I experienced any of the power or freezing issues reported by some users .Should you buy the Nokia N8 ? If you are willing to take the time to learn Symbian^3 , absolutely ! It\'ss well worth the trouble and the N8  is a wonderful smartphone ! And don\'t forget the USB On -the - Go !Edit *****I\'ve had my N8  for 6 months now and it\'s still awesome ! Here are my thoughts at 6 months .First , I should state that I\'m a power user ; I use my n8 a lot , so some of the issues  I report may not be important to you and vice versa . Firdt the cons ...Proably the most annoying is that occassionally , the data connection won\'t engage when it should . This only happens every once in a while , but it requires  reboot , rather irritating . Nokia should really fix this IMHO .The second most annoying issue is that once in a while , the email client will stop downloading emaild for several hours .It always starts up again , and it\'s more of a nuisance than an issue for me , but for people who need reliable email , this woulf be an issue .Third is the new  Ovi Store , it does weird thing . U can\'t contact support , the emails don\'t go through . If u have a long list  after the first 10 items , the others display for a few seconds then disppear . The  IM for Nokia app doesn\'t update or install correctly . Nokia , pleaseee fixr these issues .Unlike many other N8 owners apparently , I use the Nokia browser as my chief browser . It\'s a great browser , just needs full Flash , better standard support !Finally , I still haven\'t really experienced the freezing and restart that some r reporting , other than the ones common to computers  e.g.  u have many windows open or the servers r messing up , things like that , but these r normal !One last thing , Nokia really needd to take better care of their current customers by getting the updates outrather sooner ,the new N8s have been shipping with the Anna update for almost 2 months now  yet current n8 users still don\'t have it !But I must ssy , the N8 is STILL  an awedome smartphone ,and I still highly recommend it !!!update 3-22-2012this is my third N8 but that`s no reflection on Nokia ; the original one was one of the infamous first batch, which had issues , just one of those things ; the second I downloaded a bad app ( cough , norton Smartphone Security , cough ) and it fried the software . Current one , no problems !One other thing , I DEFINITELY  reccommmend the Belle update , it makes the N8 even more awesome !One last thing lol . The issues I reported earlier have been fixed by the Belle update , woo hoo!!!!'),(94,'B003ZX7RL4','June 2012,After doing a lot of research on this phone  I decided to give it a try because I needed a camera so it seemed like a good deal.  I bought it a month ago, the phone I received was dead,returned it right away, a day after I received new one (coustomer service and delivery was just amazing), which was working just fine. Camera and video features are great as expected. Most people complain about the phone freezing. Untill now I have not had such a problem, may be just luck or I updated the phone regularly.  Processor is little slow but I think it is normal for the money paid for it. Only problem I had is the digital keyboard is too small, when you text or open the browser you hit  wrong keys very often. This is a simple problem that could have been predicted and resolved properly.  Overall, I am pleased with the product it satisfied my needs. If you want this phone for internet, I would not recommend it. If you buy it for its camera and loud speaker go for it!!!I\'will update my review should I have any problem.'),(95,'B003ZX7RL4','This phone has so many features on the paper, but in reality it sucks. The processor is extremely slow. The App support is horrible. I had my share of problems with this phone right from Day 1. Recently i have upgraded the software to Symbian Anna. It has so many bugs... only god can save Nokia with this kind of a software. I am not able to download any new apps. None of the existing apps i have installed were opening. When I try to uninstall them, the phone takes 1 -2 min to return the screen back and then prompts a message saying uninstall failed. I tried to restore the factory settings, it was OK and then again the same problem with all the apps. The mail application takes ages to retrieve one single mail. It first downloads the mail headers quickly and then takes a hell lot of time even to display a simple and plain text mails with no attachments. Now a days i am using this phone only for calls and a bit of music. It was so dumb and sluggish with the rest of the things, its not worth calling this a smart phone. The call quality is good, but the call drops every now and then. I was using the Nokia 5800 express phone before this and i never had any problems with the call drops. Looking at some of the other reviews, i was wondering if i got any refurbished piece, instead of a new one. Being a Nokia fan boy, I really did not expect this kind of a phone from them. I am not going to buy any more Nokia smartphones. Switching to other smartphones in the market. Bybye Nokia.'),(96,'B003ZX7RL4','I was in need of a new phone, as my old dumb phone was falling into pieces.  I researched online and looked for something with a great camera, touch screen, and something that doesn\'t require a data plan.  My search led me to the Nokia N8.  It gave me what I wanted.  The 12MP is killer.  I\'ve been taking lots of pictures with it and the quality is phenomenizzle.  I love how I can turn of 3G and just use wifi to do online things on the phone and I don\'t have to pay a penny for data.  I love the touch screen and all the useful apps I\'ve downloaded so far.  Nokia N8 is the perfect phone for my needs.'),(97,'B003ZX7RL4','I have been using Iphone 3GS and 4 for the last 3 years.  I have two children, and every moment is precious with them.  I had DSLR, but it is not always with you when you need it. So camera function is really important to me.  Iphone 4 had a decent camera.  And its UI is very stable and easy to use. But, Apple never gives you enough and charges a lot. Long story short, I pulled the trigger and purchased Nokia N8. I have been using it for a week, and I really liked it. Yes, there are some flaws with Symbian 3. I had to consult google at least 5 times to set up stable wi-fi, emails and bluetooth with this phone.  You need some tricks - such as inserting another sim card to see yahoo mail set up option, and once you set up your yahoo email, you can put back your original sim car and it will work.  Also you can not accept meeting invite in exchange! Symbian developers missed that! Or, when in your car connected via bluetooth, the speakers of the phone will not work.  So you can use call funtion via car speakers, but if you want to listen to music from your phones speakers, your phone cant do that.  The phone defaults the speaker/headphone/bluetooth and it does not allow you to switch back and forth (maybe this function is burried somewhere in deeper options).  It is a little slow also compare to Iphone 4.  And finaly screen is smaller than iphone and not as impressive.However, if you can accept above glitches, this phone has great functions.  Here they are:- On the go USB and able to access phone folders- Best camera in any phone in the market - with photo/video editting.- HDMI - we watched couple videos over our flat screen tv and it is super!- Real GPS - yes, it takes about 2 minutes to locate a satellite but it works great and it is free!- Very good speaker- Strange enough, after a week, I really liked the UI.  It is much faster to check your emails, couple important news, facebook updates just in 30 seconds.  I do not need to go app by app and spend 3 minutes to get the same info.- I can dump my data plan.  I do have wifi at work and at home.- there are useful application at Ovi store like bloomberg and that is what I need.What i would like to improve:- Fix various software issues- Camera lens should protected better - sticking out is not a good idea- Allow users to merge widgets- Make the screen widerAbout Nokia - if you decide to win US market, invest in customer service!  People having issues with Nokia N8 should not forced to wait even a day to replace/fix the phone.  Respect your customers and do not try to get even with them esp. if the problem is caused by your product.'),(98,'B003ZX7RL4','I have been using smart phones for the better part of 15 years. Started with a Nokia 9000 and went though the windows mobile and windows CE and the rise of HTC. I have been a dedicate iPhone user from 07 to my current iPhone 4 . I also have been using Android mostly Gingerbread and soon ice-cream sandwich on an Atrix-4G. To my latest addition a new Windows Mobile HTC Titan.So with this pile of smartphones on my desk I still prefer the Nokia N8.Here are some reasons why:1) It\'s built like a tank. Seriously it\'s my 1 year old son\'s favorite toy and it does not have a scratch or a dent on it.2) it\'s an amazing camera.3) it\'s the best phone I have used in a while. It has better signal strength and great voice quality and volume. People have noticed when I am using my other phones.4) The Nokia navigation app is one of the better ones.  I would says it\'s on par with Navigon for iOS and it\'s free.5) Nokia seems to be taking care of it\'s customers.. This phone was released back at the end of 2010! it\'s an old phone. Yet I have received two major OS updates to this phone.  Anna, and Belle and will soon get MS mobile office suite all for free from Nokia.6) Works well in a Microsoft environment. There is a lync client and MS communicator, full exchange support and soon the complete MS Mobile office.Now some of the issues:1) It\'s not an iPhone.. and it never will be.. If you want a cheap iPhone get a refurbished one.2) The keyboard is not smooth as an iPhone.3) You might not have all the apps you want. Most of them are there but don\'t expect to be updated as fast as Android or iOS will be.4) Opera and the Web app work well but do act up on certain pages.Here is my synopsis, if you want to have a amazing camera and very good phone that is rugged. And, you use mostly contacts and calendar by all means have a look at this phone. If want to have all the latest apps, with all the best of the best social networking integration. I would look in to iPhone,Windows mobile and Android in that order.'),(99,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this because it was on sale here & it had features I really wanted but couldn\'t get anywhere else at the price: 1. it was unlocked 2.) I could use it internationally 3.) it had free gps 4.) it had a really good camera w/ video.This thing has been nothing but a nightmare & I will never buy another Nokia product ever again because of it. The hardware seems to be pretty good, if only the software worked so I could use it. I have never spent so much time trying to trouble shoot with an electronic device.1.) I need to connect via wifi because I don\'t have a data plan. After the latest update, wifi will simply not work for any native Nokia application, furthermore every application I try hangs & only tells you \"connection failed\" after several minutes preventing you from even using the phone for anything else. However, for some reason the Opera browser will connect to the internet because it has it\'s own wifi prompt within the application, so I know it\'s not a problem with the modem wherever I am.2.) I was able to use the gps inititially, but with the last update my maps disappeared & I have no way of getting them back (because wifi doesn\'t work & you can only update maps on a Windows computer, not on a Mac).3.) When it was working I installed some free applications from Nokia\'s webstore & all of them just wreeked havoc on the phone. I wish I could go back to the way the phone was when I first bought it but...4.) There is no way to \"restore\" your phone to factory settings. There\'s no dvd you can install original software onto it as you can with an iphone. Once the phone has been updated, you can\'t go back.5.) The phone doesn\'t save info when you update. I thought I did, but when it happened, it wouldn\'t update contacts etc. When I type in a number someone\'s name come\'s up after I\'ve already typed the full number....so the information is hiding in there somewhere, but it won\'t load into contacts, nor doestyping a single number prompt any contacts because the contacts app is blank.6.) Nokia\'s customer service is poor. Get ready to peruse many user forums to find answers to everything.7.) GPS is spotty. Sometimes it loads the address you type in, but many times it doesn\'t....Sometimes shaking your phone helps to make gps work, sometimes it doesn\'t....and sometimes after you\'ve given up & thrown the thing on the floor & it\'s been lying there for ten minutes, half way into your trip a voice suddenly tells you to turn left.8.) There are probably 100 more things that have been driving me up a wall, the long & short: I have easily spent over 100 hours to get this thing to work to just its most minimal capacity. I have had it & will never buy another Nokia product ever again.'),(100,'B003ZX7RL4','Despite the constant ribbing from iPhone and Android users, neither such device has managed to pull me away from the N8 so far. The camera takes damn good pictures (others are finally catching up) and GPS plus turn-by-turn navigation without a data plan (yes, really!) has been awesome. The GPS component is pretty sharp too: the refresh rate or processing speed keeps it from falling behind (ever had a GPS tell you to turn just after you pass that intersection?) and the level of accuracy can distinguish which side of the road I was on when using the Sports Tracker workout app. All that and 16GB onboard and room to grow via microSD.Just noticed I neglected to mention call quality -- it\'s superb, both signal and clarity, both incoming and outgoing. I still use this as a phone, so this is important to me. It also works pretty well for Skype calling, though I have yet to exploit the front-facing camera.This thing was months/years ahead of the competition, and it makes me sad that Nokia didn\'t market these better. I am tempted to pick up a spare to have standing by in case this one ever finally dies.'),(101,'B003ZX7RL4','In first place, purchase transaction on Amazon was great. And the product itself is great so far. All accessories are working as expected.I don\'t like the headphones, because earpiece must be placed deep inside the ear, if not, earpieces might fall. It is very annoying to put those inside the ear. I have to use my old N95 headphones.Regarding N8, i was not able to use all the stuff it has, but i must complain of the vibrating functionality, because it is not as strong as my previous N95, I missed several calls because i can\'t feel it vibrating.That\'s all so far.Best luck'),(102,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ve used a lot of smart phones extensively, so here\'s my take on it.PROS1. amazing camera. still unrivaled amongst phones, even the n9 is going to have a worse camera than the n8.2. snappy UI, great performance.3. great call quality (i\'m using it with an AT&T; sim card).4. GPS is matched only by google maps, with better turn-by-turn directions and the option to store maps offline so you don\'t use data when you\'re out and about (great for prepaid and for those no-longer \'unlimited\' data plans).5. solid build quality/aesthetics (i have the orange and it looks amazing)6. amazing quality screen7. impressive OS flexibility*CONS1. related to pro #2 - the snappy UI comes about because the system it\'s built on is ancient. For polish/intuitiveness, you can\'t beat iPhone/Android, even Windows Phone 7 or WebOS.2. GPS search is abysmal compared to google maps. Though comparable to car GPS systems.3. screen has low resolution**4. OVI store is not nearly as solid as Windows Phone 7/WebOS or as massive as Android Market/App Store.SPECIAL NOTES* the OS is really capable, with features built-in you wouldn\'t find on other phones. It\'s got an FM transmitter (so you can broadcast your music to your car radio). It can function as a network interface for tethering your computer. It\'s got a solid bluetooth implementation so you can drop files onto it wirelessly (can\'t do that on iPhone/iPad). Nokia also builds syncing software; not as polished as iTunes, but way better than what other companies provide; the mac syncing stuff that nokia has hooks into iCal, iPhoto, iTunes to boot.** the screen has really low resolution, but is still vibrant and crisp. because of the display, blacks are PURE black (darkness) and not backlit. you really have to see it in person to know what i mean.overall, despite its shortcomings, if you know what to expect, you won\'t be disappointed. especially for the price you get for this at amazon, the GPS/camera alone make it worth more than any HD android phone out there for anyone who doesn\'t like to be under contract.'),(103,'B003ZX7RL4','I am very disappointed with this phone. I bought it with great expectations and it worked fine for like three weeks...then suddenly, although charged, the phone will not come on. I went online and realised it\'s a worldwide problem. The solution online short of returning the phone was to put it in the freezer for a while....Now who spends big bucks on a cell phone to keep it in the freezer? This is ridiculous and Nokia should be ashamed to still have this phone on the market. This is a clear product defect. What a rip off....looking online for a new phone now...and right mow my thinking is anything but Nokia.'),(104,'B003ZX7RL4','Bought this to replace my trusty Nokia E71.  Looking for fullscreen email and browsing phone, although my primary need is great call call quality anywhere in the world.  I\'m not a big apps person and only a moderate texter, Twitterer and Facebook user.Bottom line, the phone was returned.  Music player interface was too clunky (can\'t play find/play a song only artist from shuffle mode), automatic Bluetooth connection with my Acura was too hit or miss (E71 is consistently rock solid with the same car)and QuickOffice not included (must be purchased separately). eMail w/ embedded HTML still does not work within Mail for Exchange.Liked the fullscreen email and browser, but the navigation was clunky (not just different, unintuitive). Having the larger screen does make browsing and emails much easiser to read and reply to.  The screen is great both for reading and typing.  Didn\'t miss the hard keys as much as I thought I would, although I agree with the other posts that a portrait keyboard would be nice for those of us used to one-handed typing.As with all Nokias, call quality and battery life were awesome.  I was nervous not being able to swap batteries on multi-day trips to India and China but the N8 battery had enough capacity for the one trip I made while I had it.As the price as come down, the N8 is worth it for you gadget people and people that need a fullscreen phone.  For those of us who just want something that works, an E71 or perhaps an E72 is just fine.'),(105,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this camera/phone primarily for the camera.  I wanted a pocketable video/still camera that would deliver good quality videos that would not disappoint when viewed on a TV and pictures I could include on my signature photo-collages.  The video quality is quite good as viewed on my computer monitor.  I have not yet printed any stills, but the screen quality is also quite good.  The photos are sharp and detailed with no noticeable color fringing.  The shutter lag is acceptable when pre-focusing is done.  The only problem I had was with taking video with too many other apps open.  I got sound, but the frames froze, probably due to lack of free memory for processing the video frames.Angry birds plays well on this phone. Hard to keep it out of my 3 and 5 year old kids hands due to this.Oh, and by the way, the phone works well too.'),(106,'B003ZX7RL4','The Nokia N8 that I\'ve received turns off, freeze and is very difficult to turn it on again (generally it breaks) during initial start. It seems a manufactoring problem as shown in [...]My real concern is that I\'m from Brazil and asked for a friend(that was travelling) to buy and bring the cell phone from USA for me. Nokia Brazil Repair Center says that can\'t repair an item bought in USA and I can\'t send the phone to the USA because I don\'t have an american valid address.So it seems that I will have to live with this problem and this is the cause I didn\'t like the product.'),(107,'B003ZX7RL4','Now this is a difficult review in that the phone has serious strengths and weaknesses.  In order for a phone to be a first class communication device, it must be joined by both performance, reliability, but most importantly usability.  I believe that this phone would be an outstanding smart phone anywhere around the world, minus the U.S.  I believe that Apple, Google, and even Windows Phone 7 has way surpassed Nokia Symbian^3 in UI.  That being said I\'d like to offer up my viewpoints of the N8 having come from Iphone 4.PROs1. Hardware built quality, reliability, reception performance, call quality, speaker phone, noise cancellation, battery life are all something that comes to mind immediately2. Overall build quality is exceptional, unlike Samsung, LGs of the world, this phone is built to last.  Even HTC does not measure up in terms of quality build.3. AMOLED screen is nice and bright, color contrast is pretty good, minus the resolution4. Reception and call quality is great, coming from the Iphone4, the N8 is a God send. I no longer have dropped calls, callers can hear me, and I can actually use the speaker phone function and have no issues with callers not being able to hear me.  The Iphone had a major problem in this area in that it can\'t reliabily connect to a bluetooth headset, or use the speaker phone without your voice breaking up or the callers.  Bluetooth connected on the N8 without incident.5. Noise cancellation is an area that I think Nokia has perfected, I get better noise cancellation with Nokia period than any other I\'ve tried, ie iphone4, HTC, LG or Samsung.6. battery life for a smart phone is surprising good.  Unlike my iphone 4 or HTC having to charge constantly7. if you are a world traveller, you will appreciate the Nokia maps.  It allows you to travel the world and have navigation map capabilities withou wifi. I mean anywhere Nokia has a map for that country.  It is also nice that domestically when you travel to an area without wifi or cell signal, I can still find my way around with Nokia maps, unlike google maps or Microsoft bing maps will stop functioning or provide directions.CONs1. Small screen @ 3.5 inch. spec wise the same as Iphone4, but in reality smaller.2. Low, inadequate resolution @640x360, in today\'s market, it\'s a joke.3. The UI on Symbian^3 is just not right for the US market.  We live in a society where we are only concerned about having, and not about conserving.  Nokia really lost out in this market.  I can understand why Nokia is strong elsewhere, but have absolutely been drowned out here in the US.  I\'m not so sure that Windows Phone 7 or 8 can change that because they will now also be restricted by the same software heavy, resource intensive burden everyone else has to deal with, and that is more cpu power=lower battery life.4. web browser is not the greatest, it is spotty and doesn\'t allow for decent browsing, even with Opera, it\'s still why behind the web experience of an Iphone45. A serious lack of main stream application support by US companies, I can\'t even get Pandora, or speedtest for symbian.  Of course Google maps is only half functioning on Symbian^3.  So don\'t expect a great many useful apps for Symbian^3.  Nokia has completely lost sight at the wheel on this.6. Processor speed at 680Mhz ARM 11 is simply not speedy.  It gets the job done, but come on... a faster processor would help a lot.7. Nokia has tray away from their core and has made a phone that just takes too many step just to make a call.  they took out the hard call button that worked real well.  A number shows up on screen, click call, that\'s it.  Now instead, you have to push one button to retrieve one number than click on the number then you can call.  That also holds true with many other parts of the Nokia Symbian^3 os.  boy, they definitely need help there.I\'m sorry but the reason we have such crap products these days is that all companies are trying to do is compete on price point.  They keep scaling back on everything to meet a price point instead of just doing it right by building the right phone.  While I understand economics, but companies have become way too profit driven on the other end.  We need to promote and demand more consumer centric innovation, and not profit focus.Now having said all of the above, I think the N8 is still a great communicator, from a phone standpoint. I\'m torn between having a phone that is well built + a nice 7\" tablet or 10\" if permits; or have one massive crammed smartphone at 4.5in. I loved everything about the iphone4 except the simple inability of Apple to provide reliable bluetooth headset connectivity; or something as simple as being able to use the speaker phone that actually works in real life, usable is all I ask.  How tough is that.  I hope Steve Jobs will not try and rush a product for profit, and ruin a loyal following over the years based on merits of his products.  All the other phones out there are all trying to throw as many buzz technology to lure customers, but non will last very long, or perform like a Nokia phone.  So I\'m one frustrated user where I\'d like many aspects of a Nokia in its reliability and performance of a phone, but not so good with web and apps.Hope all this would help someone else making a decision'),(108,'B003ZX7RL4','I read about this phone rebooting but thought I\'d roll the dice.  Notice above this review that I am a real customer and did buy this phone from Amazon.I so much wanted to like this phone because it is sleek, daddy Google/Apple isn\'t watching you, and it has a lot of nice features (16GB + memory slot, offline GPS with maps, HD camera/video.)  Unfortunately the phone is just unusable.When I received the phone first thing I did was charge it up.  Then I connected it to NokiaSuite to update the OVI maps.  Disconnected from PC and hooked into power supply and WIFI, did not put in sim card or memory card.  Tried to run OVI maps in offline mode... crash/reboot.  Updated OS (1.1, Anna?), tried again ... crash/reboot.  Updated OS again (1.2, Belle?) tried OVI maps again... CRASH/REBOOT!!!  Updated OVI maps through the OVI store, got further into new maps until I tried to download maps... REBOOT!!!  Tried OVI maps without being plugged into power supply, crash/reboot.  Tried Skype, same thing.  I did however change the language from automatic to English and this helped, was able to make a Skype call, however OVI maps still reboots.  Also ran the web browser after OS updates and this causes a reboot as well!!!I have not done a hard reset because I don\'t want to lose the apps that came installed on the phone, and you shouldn\'t have to do this anyway.Nokia knows there is an issue with the phone, but in my opinion they either don\'t know exactly what it is or don\'t want to fess up that it is a design flaw, so I don\'t want to roll the dice with Nokia support.  Many people mentioned sending it in for repair and getting it back still broken.  Working in the firmware field a device like mine is ideal since I can get it to reboot consistently, so it should be a fairly straightforward task for Nokia to figure out what the problem is!!For less money I might have kept it as a science experiment, but I need the cash to put toward a different phone.It is with a sad and heavy heart that I must confess I will be returning this phone.'),(109,'B003ZX7RL4','I was initially disappointed that only 3 of 7 folks found my review of the N8 useful. Over the last year I have however come to know Nokia fans. Overtime, the poor perception of my review here has made more and more sense to me. In using this phone, I have had to scour user threads and am following a few Nokia feeds via social media. I thought Apple fans were zealots until I came to know Nokia fans. If you are a Nokia fan, read on so you can flame me and refute my review as sour grapes by a lazy user. If you genuinely want to discern whether this is a worthy purchase, read on so you can gather data to make an informed choice._____________________________________________________________________________I own this... it\'s a nightmare. I have to reboot it up to 3 times per day.I am hugely disappointed since it\'s got so much unrealized potential. The feature list is spectacular... A true unlocked world phone that works on any GSM network... bluetooth, FM Radio in and out... microSD slot, great camera(on paper), HD video, great OviMaps vector based map with GPS.... but it is hampered by an underpowered processor (it is S L O W) and software that seems at times like it\'s an Alpha release. I bought it thinking Nokia would address the bugs over time, but 8 months later (and over a year after it was released), and I am still fighting with this device. Nokia zealots might tell me i am stupid, and do not know how to use the phone... but I assure you, I am quite patient, work in IT, and also work with Android and iOS devices. They are all awful, but this Symbian is especially bad. I wish someone could port Meego to it (but i know it\'s not possible). One can dream.[10/26/2011 UPDATE]Nokia has finally released an update to the software that runs on this Phone (Symbian). Anna is finally available to US N8 owners. It makes the phone much more usable. You\'ll need to back up your phone data (just to be safe) before you apply the update.In using Anna for the last three days, the phone seems much more stable. Still issues remain: Kinetic scrolling behaves much like on my hated android phone. When using a swipe to scroll, the page you are looking at can whisk well past where you wish to be, it almost seems to accelerate as your data zips past in a blur.Yet, when using the dial pad during an active call, for say entering a pass-code for voice mail, or navigating a set of touch-tone menus, there is lag in the release of the keys. So it sounds like a slow moving senior citizen is working your phone. It also can cause you to enter the wrong sequence of keys. You have to type s l o w l y... It\'s annoying when you are accustomed to a snappy iOS or even (gag) android.On a positive note, in addition to less lag and more stability, reception seems better, I am consistently getting better signal for data.[October 28th 2011 UPDATE]Last night I had to reboot the phone because it could not get a GPS lock. It picked it up almost immediately after the reboot. Yesterday I also noticed the phone is stuck in silent mode (I have rebooted it several times and un-installed an application called Nokia Situations, which changes the phone status based on parameters you set, the uninstall has not resolved the issue). When I installed Anna, I also installed the Anna Service pack 1. I am currently re-downloading Anna and am going to do a \"fresh\" install and start again just to see if these issues are from the import of some of my old data, or from some of the apps I\'ve installed, including \"Nokia Situations\" which is a beta app.[March 13th 2012]I have been using Nokia\'s Belle update for several weeks now. The the user experience has again been improved, but only marginally. The menus are more pleasant and customizable.I still have to reboot the phone frequently, there is still significant lag in the UI.I continue to uncover additional annoyances and critical flaws:My latest peeves which have been well documented elsewhere:Vibrate: The phone does not vibrate strongly enough and I frequently miss calls because of it. Nokia fans will of course fault me for being an insensitive neanderthal.Loss of settings: I cannot pin point what causes this, (yet), but I frequently lose custom theme settings. For instance, I set silent mode to vibrate (albeit anemically, see above), but 2 times now, I have found the phone snapped back to the default of \"no vibrate\"Lockup on incoming call.At least a couple of times a month, the screen becomes unresponsive as I am getting a phone call.It seems like the phone is doing something else and sometimes becomes responsive, but only after the caller has hung up.Camera:white balance.It\'s really unpredictable. Even when I force the settings, there is this bizarre color shift where the camera will be set to one light condition, but shift white balance from shot to shot, as if it were on Auto WB.You cannot turn off the hokey shutter Sound.Turning off the flash has to be the last custom setting you make before you take the shot.If you turn the flash off, then adjust to, say Macro, you have to again turn the flash off.The phone has so much potential, an I still want to like it, but have found it to be nothing but frustrating to use.'),(110,'B003ZX7RL4','The phone is really unlocked and ofcourse with excellent nokia workmanship. I just inserted my tmobile sim and it was up and running. The call quality is good. i had no issues what so ever with this phone. wi-fi connection was a breeze....love this phone. I do not have a data plan but am connected most of the time to my home wi-fi and cable vision wi-fi hot spots when i am on the go. The GPS works flawless. Takes a little longer to connect to GPS signal but once connected does a excellent job.......strongly recomend this phone'),(111,'B003ZX7RL4','I am a huge Nokia fan and have owned one since the brick came out 14 years ago.The n8 is a terrific phone but has a lot of bugs in it. The hardware is very good but the software needs help. I am guessing that Nokia released quickly and will update the software soon (hopefully).Pros:Camera is perfect and has replaced all my other cameras. Video has stabilization so you can shoot perfect videos. HD is nice but files are huge (sync takes forever if you record a video).Design is good. Buttons are in good places and the front panel is nicely protected.Symbian OS is very lean (like Linux) and has some good properties (like saving battery life).Phone is lite but still feels sturdy.Cons:Phone has lost the SIM card twice for me. I have seen this is a problem. Not sure why but suspect having phone in pocket is a cause.Old Symbian apps do not work.UI is a little clunky. Also, when on a phone my face touches the screen and activates the buttons. That needs fixed.Not a lot of apps, don\'t expect a ton of apps until the programmers get the SDK. I tried to get but the process is long and hard.So, I am happy with the phone and for the camera alone, it was worth the price. But I am a little disappointed in Nokia and they need to get the software and apps problems solved.BTW: I borrowed my daughters iPhone 4 and my friends Android to compare. N8 is faster but clunkier and N8\'s battery lasts way longer.hope this helps.'),(112,'B003ZX7RL4','Used this phone for about 20 days & to be honest, I was looking for an excuse to keep it...But i returned it at last...Pros: Great design,Cool camera for daylight,Sound quality is good.Cons: Applications run slow, shut down in the middle of the function,WiFi is horrible, it cuts itself off from the internet, could not use an uninterrupted internet using WiFi.Night photograph quality is not good.Could not run two applications at the same time without getting stuck.There are some other features i did not like but that is my personal opinion. Anybody may like those.I am not sure that whether the one that i used had these problems or all of the Nokia N8 phones have the same problems. I have been using Nokia phones since 2000 and this was my first touchscreen phone from Nokia. I was really looking forward to use this phone.'),(113,'B003ZX7RL4','The Nokia N8 that I\'ve received turns off, freeze and is very difficult to turn it on again, during initial start. It seems a manufactoring problem.I have upgraded the cell phone, uninstall all the applications acquiredby Ovi, enable the factory settings and even the failure continues.The problem is that I\'m from Venezuela, and buy the product from Venezuela to amazom.com, nokiaVenezuela did not accept any kind of warranty.Is there any way to validate the warranty, and really the model of phoneI like, and also very expensive.Really appreciate any solution ..... good dayDiego Moreno'),(114,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this device about two weeks ago and couldn\'t be happier.If you are thinking about purchasing this device you have to ask yourself a few questions about what type of person you are regarding electronic devices.If you are a person that needs something completely idiot-proof, don\'t buy this device. There\'s always a trade off when making decisions like this, one of them in the smartphone world is capability vs. ease of use.The Nokia N8 has yet to show me something it can\'t do - you just have to know how to use it.If you aren\'t familiar with the symbian system, it will take some getting used to. It\'s not as intuitive as an iPhone.That said it can do many, many things at a fraction of the price compared to an iphone.My main example of this is the ability to tether, for free... or if you like there\'s a $9 app that allows you to turn the device into a mobile hotspot. Currently, I\'m still on an old AT&T; plan and still have unlimited data, by simply taking the sim card out of my old device and putting it in the N8 I had upgraded to a smartphone without having to change anything on my At&T; contract.Additionally the Navigation software is really good as well as the camera.Some of my pros:-12 MP camera with flash-tethering/hotspot capability-video/photo editing software-full GPS with turn by turn directionsthe cons:-UI isn\'t idiot proof-the app store isn\'t massive, but it\'s growing and so pandora radio is all I\'ve missed. (actually there\'s a better alternative called soundtrckr)- it can be slow if you have a lot of things running simultaneously e.g. internet TV and the mobile hotspot.'),(115,'B003ZX7RL4','Let me describe an event at work,.......during a meeting when 30+ people are present, someone\'s phone rings...  It is a familiar and typical iphone ringtone.  most of the people start fumbling their pockets or start looking at their(i)phone to check if its their phone ringing.  iphone has become real common commodity.., believe it or not..For those who really wants to be unique, especially from iphone users (as per my experience) and feel special about it, this is the phone for you.All right, sentiments apart...Here is my take on this phone.  I bought this phone from Amazon shortly after its launch and using it ever since.Since so many users have posted very good and accurate reviews about Nokia N8 with Pros and Cons here, I am focusing mainly on user experience and some WOW factors that other phones can not/do not offer (for free).- Only smartphone that dose not mandate you to subscribe a smart phone data plan without loosing most of its functionality (or without rooting/jailbreaking etc.) savings of $35 a month since day one....I bought this one at full price but its free after a year of use just because of data plan savings.  I still use low priced data plan and take full advantages of smartphone features like anywhere email, upload pic directly to facebook, local searches etc etc.-  Internet on the go anywhere anytime (with data plan subscription, of-course).  I just plug in my phone to my laptop using usb cable and my laptop is connected to internet.  I can also use my phone as wifi hot spot and tether data to my ipad hassle free.  saved few hundred dollars and bought only wifi version of ipad.  saved hundreds more when no data plan needed for ipad.  More savings.......and same great ipad experience!!!!-  Great camera, takes amazing natural looking pictures unlike other smartphones which tend to over saturate colors to look them better on phone screen.  I regularly use nokia n8 to take pictures at work and add it as a part of my presentation.  Looks really hi quality even if projected on big screen.  I did receive many complements from my (mostly iphone using) co-workers.-  Free GPS with no data plan requirement added spoken direction with street names in more than 30 languages, online traffic updates and many other bells and whistles...Self explanatory....I never have to carry my gps while on the go, as true with any other smartphones.  Where n8 beats every one is native voice guided navigation in multiple languages without using a data plan (and using it if you want to)I set my route in the phone and let it sit somewhere on dashboard.  95% of the time I could navigate just by listening to the voice guidance without looking at the tiny map screen on the phone.  The voice guidance is very clear and spoken street names really makes the driving in unknown place a breeze as you are simply focusing on driving.  My wife is so jealous just because of this feature.- HDMI out -  I connect my phone to my lcd tv using the provided cable and play Need for Speed (free with phone).Can wirelessly connect to the Laptop !!  DLNA sharing app lets me connect and stream my pics and vids from my phone wirelessly to my laptop, which i connect to my tv and share my pics as a slide show to friends at home while me sitting on couch holding the phone in my hand.Well, these are the features and experiences that makes me love this phone, the part I love the most is that these things come with it at a substantially lower price upfront and significant lower monthly cost, not to mention freedom of using it over any GSM network and not having sign a two year contract.!!!!Obviously, this phone has its shortcomings and trade offs, and many reviews here describe them accurately.For me, the cons are,-  screen could have been larger,-  clunky user interface-  soon to be obsolete OS-  speaker on the back of the phone right below the camera module, significantly reduces the sound volume if the phone is lying on bed speaker facing downwards.-  App store experience could have been better.However, it has been more good experience than bad. Constantly attracting curious looks from people when they see me using this phone, and many of them drop their jaw when they hear that it has 12 MP camera.I dont mean to show iphone down by any means and I personally feel that iphone s user interface is much better.However I do not regret buying Nokia N8 at all.America is a country of freedom and this is the only device that gives me true freedom of choosing any service provider, choosing to opt for a smart phone data plan or not, not binding myself into two year contract and still able to enjoy a smartphone experience and not to forget freedom of using (free) GPS signals without paying for navigation service using the device you own.'),(116,'B003ZX7RL4','I OWN NOKIA N85 NOKIA N95 8GB NOKIA N96 NOKIA N900 AND NOW NOKIA N8.

HAY AFTER ALL THE FUN THAT YOU CAN HAVE WITH THIS PHONE YOU CAN ALSO MAKE CALLS TOO.'),(117,'B003ZX7RL4','A bit of an introduction: I\'m a retired computer professional, having written software and managed software projects for 45 years. I have been a vocal critic (on the Nokia forums) of Nokia\'s software failings in recent years (I had an E71, a beautiful piece of hardware, and my wife had an E62 and a 5800). Most of my objections were to their pathetic ovi.com website, the attempt to replace PC Suite with something else named ovi (which broke something that wasn\'t broke! I suspect \"ovi\" is Finnish for \"full of bugs\"), and their penchant for issuing \"upgrades\" that introduced more problems than they fixed.I had a two-year fling with Android, where I saw a serious mobile system gradually turn into a circus act; the latest version of Android on the top Samsung phones looks like a video game to me. They are obviously targeting the young, which is probably a smart business decision. But if you are a mature adult who wants a serious appliance that helps to keep you organized and to communicate via voice and message, all of this extraneous nonsense is a distraction and an annoyance. Yes, some of what bothered me could have been customized away, but there were other issues that led me to conclude that the latest Android was not for me.I had watched, with interest, the introduction of the N8 by Nokia and its impressive specifications, and the subsequent tribulations of the product, plagued by problems that resulted in too many dead devices. But two years after its introduction, with the price dropping and unhappy with the direction of Android, I decided to buy one. I\'ve had the phone now for a little over a month, and I must say I\'m pleasantly surprised.First of all, the hardware. It is typical Nokia, just beautifully made. It makes a difference, as it is not only a pleasure to hold something well-made, but it feels better in the hand than anything I\'ve owned from other manufacturers (Motorola, Samsung). It was delivered with Symbian Anna, which exhibited some of the old, confusing user-interface design that has brought Nokia to the brink of extinction. After consultation with some folks on the Nokia forums, I decided to upgrade to Belle, about which the signals were mixed. I decided that the people who seemed to know what they were talking about liked the system and I went with their advice. This turned out to be a good decision. The user-interface is greatly improved and finally gives Symbian a look and work-flow that is competitive with Android or the iPhone. Unfortunately for Nokia and Symbian enthusiasts, it comes too late. But it\'s good, nonetheless. They also fixed some bugs that I cared about. For example, the FM radio application, which I use, did not work correctly in Anna, at least for me. The Belle version is fine. I am happy with everything else that I use -- contacts, calendar, email, browser, occasional text message. The camera is excellent. The only thing that does not work well, and never has, is Mail for Exchange, at least when you attempt to use it to sync with Google contacts/calendar. This software was broken three and four years ago and it\'s still broken. I have resorted to going back to maintaining my contacts, calendar and todos with Microsoft Outlook, which is an inconvenience for me, since I use Unix/Linux most of the time, not Windows. But Nokia\'s synchronization application works well, as does Google\'s application to sync their stuff with Outlook. A bit of a Rube Goldberg setup, but it works. It would have been far better for Nokia to have fixed Mail for Exchange -- they certainly had ample notice that it was bug-ridden -- but that won\'t happen now that they are fighting for their lives, hoping to be rescued by Windows 8.To summarize, if you want a superbly-made unlocked phone made for serious adults at a good price, this is a great choice. Be aware, though, that Nokia has, of course, abandoned Symbian (Accenture is maintaining it now) and it is unlikely that there will be any further development of the system. It\'s a dead-end for application writers as well, though there is a large body of Symbian applications already available. Whether they work well with Belle is a separate question (I purchased a financial calculator for my E71, and got the latest version for the N8. It worked fine with Anna, and while it works with Belle, the results appear in a font about 2 pixels high, and so it is unusable. I have contacted the author and he is unable to fix the problem, due to some authentication issue. It\'s obviously a side-effect of Symbian now being a dinosaur.)Update (3/24/2013):I\'ve now had the N8 for almost 6 months, and my opinion of the phone has not changed. If anything, I\'m even more impressed by its quality and usability. One issue: battery life. Running Belle, with light usage, the battery is exhausted by the end of the day and has to be recharged for the next day\'s use. However, there is a so-called \"power-saving mode\", and it works beautifully. With this enabled, the battery will last for days, at least the way I use the phone. For me, the phone is perfectly usable in this mode, and the improvement in battery life is a real plus. Before I discovered this, there were times when I was inconvenienced by having forgotten to put the phone on the charger overnight, needing to use it the next day, and finding it dead. Yes, it recharges quickly, but an inconvenience when I want to use it NOW. The tremendous improvement in battery life in power-saving mode essentially eliminates this problem.I would also mention that there is a battery monitor application available from the Nokia store that is quite useful, and I recommend it to anyone using an N8.'),(118,'B003ZX7RL4','I have been a Nokia user for years, owning a number of their Symbian phones (N75-3, N95-3, E71-2, E72-2, N97-3). I was eager to get this because it appeared as if it was Symbian 5th (S^1) done correctly which is what I was looking for, not to mention the camera really sucked me in. It\'s been a month and a half since I began using this as my primary device, and I\'ve spent considerable time using it and comparing it to my N97 and Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S).Overall, the N8 doesn\'t appear to me to be a completely finished product software wise. While comparing it to my N97, I noticed that a number of features that I found very to be useful and loved were gone, like the customizable equalizer in the music player (I\'m hoping Nokia gives it back to us in the next firmware update), and the GPS Data application that we always had. Still, there were other things that made me wonder what the software developers were doing during the testing phase of Symbian^3, like how there\'s no way to send an MMS message that gets stuck in your Outbox, or how there\'s no menu option to add a song to a playlist from the Now Playing screen like there was in S^1. There are plenty of other examples I can give as well, not to mention all the inconsistencies across the UI. But it\'s not all bad. In fact there\'s a lot to like about it.Here\'s what I liked about it:The camera is fantastic but it will take some time to really master it. Nevertheless its really easy to take a very good quick shot of something, and did I mention how real the coloring is? The days of fake reds and yellows are gone. Video recording is very good. It may not be quite as smooth as the iPhone 4, but there\'s no overexposure problems, coloring is real, and the audio is by far the best on the market. You can edit your photos and videos right on the phone, unlike with my Captivate, and thank you Nokia for still putting a very good camera button on the side of the phone unlike some other phone makers who don\'t have one at all (I can\'t stand that about a lot of Android phones). Reception is typical Nokia aka top notch, and phone calls are crystal clear. I love Nokia\'s Profile\'s that allow you to personalize your ringers and tones, and create and customize your own so you can have different ones for different times of the day. Build quality is very good; the best next to the E71. HDMI will actually display the whole UI on your TV unlike certain Android phones which only display your videos. It has a microSD card slot that\'s easily accessible and USB OTG which allows you to connect any FAT32 formatted flash drive to the phone which is really cool. Finally we have multiple homescreens on Symbian, and you can still create folders in the application menu to organize all your apps just like we\'ve always been able to do. I love the home key that doubles as a notification light and I\'m glad its a physical key. Ovi Sync which backs up your contacts, calendar and notes to a server is great. Ovi Maps (v3.06 which does not come with the phone because it\'s still in beta but has multitouch) is really good. The GPS on this is the best I have ever seen. The single speaker is actually pretty loud (though my N95-3 still sounds louder). Finally we have threaded SMS although it\'s not done properly. Video playback is very good and it has a long list of formats that will work. The music player UI looks good but is missing key features that were there in my N97 that I always used. However, I really like how disconnecting your headphones while music is playing pauses the song. Also, the volume seems to have more intervals than in previous Nokia\'s. I like how this isn\'t always connected via a data connection like a lot of Android devices (My Captivate eats through data because so many apps are constantly downloading information, like Facebook, Twitter, Weather apps, etc). Haptic feedback is really good, and at times you will really think you\'re actually pressing a real button. Love how it has a front facing camera unlike practically everything you get today from the carriers (thank you unlocked phone market). Love the screen saver that shows the time and any notifications. The battery will get you through the day as long as you aren\'t syncing email at all times during the day or running any homescreen widgets all the time like Accuweather. I was pleasantly surprised about that, although, if you\'re going out on Friday night and you did a lot of web browsing during the day, charge it before you go out. Ovi Suite, as much as it still needs work, is really nice to have since you can use it to back up your phone data and download maps to your phone for Ovi Maps. I love how the phone can connect to your computer as a storage device and NOT have to be used through a specific software like iTunes. I like how you can set any song you have as a ringtone, and you can do this through the music player too (again thanks to it being unlocked). The email client has a great implementation of pinch to zoom unlike the Gmail client on my Captivate which has none or the email application on it, which does a poor job of it. Leave it to Nokia to give you multitasking without rules or limits, and I like the familiar Symbian feel it still has to it.What I didn\'t like:There is no customizable equalizer to fine tune the sound in the music player (only presets that don\'t do much of anything). The non-removable battery, no matter what you try and tell me, will always be something I don\'t like. Don\'t bother using red-eye reduction before taking a photo because it just makes the subjects\' eyes look weird. Just edit the photo afterwards. I personally find the 3.5\" display to be a little too narrow (a 3.7\" would have been better. There are no stereo speakers like on previous Nseries. There\'s a number of missing menu options that should otherwise be there, the settings menu needs to be restructured badly, and there are too many UI inconsistencies. The Facebook and Twitter apps are terrible compared to ones you get on Android. There is no portrait QWERTY, the landscape QWERTY is not designed like it should be (like the ones on Android, iOS), and the current keyboard takes up the entire display. Certain aspects of the UI are too small to be finger friendly. I find the homescreen switch button to be pointless and think it should be a customizable shortcut instead. The email client is slow and does not display HTML correctly all the time. 256MB of RAM is acceptable but 512MB of RAM would have been much better for every type of user. But I do push this phone hard. Kinetic scrolling speed is not consistent across the UI. In some applications a quick flick will give you a fast scroll, and in other applications it will give you a medium pace scroll. The phone is slower than it should be at times, like when browsing through your loaded SMS Inbox, and when Ovi Sync is running. There are the unnecessary annoying connection notifications which I can\'t stand, and I don\'t like how tapping on a link in a text message results in a pop-up instead of simply opening the link. The web browser needs at lot of work UI and page loading wise. I\'m still getting all those (you are now leaving a secure website...) prompts when I just want to get to my web page. There is a slight hesitation on the first pinch to zoom in the photo gallery. Only 3 homescreens while Android has 7. The camera UI needs work, and by work, I mean completely redone. No LED flash means no flashlight/video light. There\'s no touch to focus in the camera for stills or video recording, and you will be cleaning the camera lens a lot. The number of apps available for the U.S. market is a joke compared to Android and iOS\'s app catalog. Smart dialing only looks for names instead of both names and numbers.As much as I really wanted to love this phone, I can\'t because of the software and all the things that were left out. Until the software gets updated and the UI gets redone, and all the things that are missing get put back in, I can only give this 3 stars overall, even though it definitely has the potential to get 5. Don\'t get me wrong, I like this phone, and I\'m going to keep it, but I\'m not completely happy with it yet. Maybe in January I will be. As far as recommending this, it\'s the best choice if you want a camera phone, but until the app store starts getting the top 100 apps in the Android Market and iTunes App Store, I really can\'t recommend this to anyone in the U.S. market who just wants a nice smartphone.For those who have Nokia phones, and are looking at getting this, it\'s better than anything else Nokia has offered at this point. But that\'s really not saying much. Symbian^3 is good, but not where it needs to be. Thankfully, there is an update planned for Q1 next year that will bring a lot of changes, but only a few which are known at this point, like the portrait QWERTY. I would wait until that update comes, and then make your decision. Also, there is a second update planned for Q3 next year where the UI will be redone.For those who have Android devices or an iPhone, I highly doubt that you\'ll like Symbian as it is now. In fact, I know you won\'t since I also own the Captivate. UI wise it\'s a step backwards and the app store doesn\'t have anywhere near the number of U.S. centric apps the other two platforms have. Unless you really want a great camera/media device/phone, I really think that you\'ll be more disappointed with this than anything, even with all the little things the N8 can do that others can\'t. Maybe after the upcoming software update, it might be more appealing, but again, if you want apps, there aren\'t that many good ones. Try it for yourself though. Maybe you\'ll like it.'),(119,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought my Nokia N8 silver in march 2011. Since then my experience with the phone was kinda so-so. Its a great looking phone, but operational system is not user friendly. Maybe that\'s why we don\'t see too many Nokias out there. So far I have seen only one Nokia N8 in a public exept mine. In a ocean full with Iphones and samsungs, Nokia is a lonely fish. Couple days ago I had to make a sudden purchase from ebay and my phone was the only opinion to do it. Took me more that an hour to buy the item and I had to use friends Iphone to finish the transaction and pay for the item, my phone was way too slooooooooow. God forbid if you have to deal with Nokia Customer service, they are the most clueless people in the world. Yesterday the camera on the phone stopped working and after 3 calls to Nokia Im not even close to solve the problem. They gave me some web site- palcocellphonerepears that doesn\'t work neither. I would never buy Nokia again, overall I\'m very disappointed with Nokia. Stay away!'),(120,'B003ZX7RL4','Well I have owned Nokia\'s for about 15 years. Each Nokia has lasted me around 4 years. My last Nokia (which I still have and use as a internet device aroudn the house) was the Nokia N95-3. This was the greatest phone ever created at the time (in my opinion) and set the bar for phones to follow. This revolutionized my subway travel experience and I would listen to music, play a game, send texts, and go online all at once and it was a pleasure to use. It did have a few problems with shutting off without notice and rebooting which was annoying but the pro\'s greatly outweighed the con\'s. Up until recently I ordered the Nokia N8. I have followed all the reviews on this phone and personally, when i get a phone I am in it for the long haul because I hate to constantlty refigure the settings, music etc...so my choice had to be as close to optinal as possible. My Nokia N95 took many videos of my family events and vacations in near DVD quality video and had an on board video and photo editor that many people could not believe I did the work I did on my phone riding the NYC subways. So to pick a new phone is like picking a new technological relationship. I chose the Nokia N8 because of the advanced 12 mp photography and Xenon flash. I know that other people had interface and software problems but I wanted to wait until the Anna update was in place and somewhat tried. When my phone arrived, it had Anna pre-installed which I was happy about as it was unclear that it was being shipped with Anna. So, here is my review of the N8.The User interface is something to get used to coming from a dual slider N95. It is slightly overly responsive and takes some getting used to. I am used to the Symbian system so setting up book marks cuts down on the tap\'age that is needed to do simple tasks. The Rhapsody interface was a problem at first but when in doubt, erase and re-add usually does the trick for licensed music. Multi-tasking does not seem to lag despite the lower RAM. I am very power conscious and usually do not keep more than 3 or 4 programs open at one time. Camera is brilliant. Have not taken any videos yet but will do so soon. I am expecting 30 fps with Anna. Internet is very good and reasonably fast (faster than my N95). Screen is great but again, Touch is a new thing and takes some getting used to. The phone itself is a work of art but slippery so I ordered a case for it. Short cuts are key so set them up asap. Power management is pretty good. I expect about 1 day of heavy use which I have gotten for the past few days and with time I will need to charge during the day i am sure. Have not tried the GPS but I am sure it will work ok. N95 was a little basic but did the job so hopefully N8 will be better. One very annoying thing is the voice dialing. On N95 it was a tinny computer voice that was fairly rough sounding but worked. i had expcected the N8 to have an updated clearer voice but it is the same, if not more tinny than the N95! After 4 years, not clearer? Voice commands are a must. That needs improvement. Text in portriat mode also needs to be a little bigger. A little difficulty to type but maybe that will get easier in time. All in all, I am happy with the N8. You just need to customize it to your liking. Flashlight would be great if it had a spare workable LED.  I was waiting for an optical zoom to come out and actually today I think I heard there is one coming next year from Nokia. I am a Nokia Loyalist so hopefully in another 4 years there will be all I want and more. Other phones do a nice job but the Nokia, I think, is still built to last. I would like to give 5 stars but I will save that for a better operating system and software. Symbian 3^ just feels like an upgraded version of the N95 Symbian that looks a little nicer but has the same engine under the hood. My wife mentioned that when I got the N95 I was so amazed by the device and she noticed that after I had this one, I looked underwhelmed. Maybe but to be fair, N8 is still very new and I do like it but as a testomonial to the N95, it has big shoes to fill in terms of being an easy to use workhorse. I do miss playing Chess on N95. Touch screen Chess without a Styulis pen is very difficult. I looked at the N9 but the high price, questionable compatibility with T-mobile, Micro Sim, lack of expandable memory, and lower resolution and flash quality made me opt for the N8. Amazon reviews helped me with my decision so I hope this review helps others. Also, Amazon was fantastic in delivery and packaging.'),(121,'B003ZX7RL4','This is a really smart phone, made for grown ups. I bought it for the very impressive 12 MP camera, said to be the best phone camera currently available. I want to have a camera with me all the time that takes pictures of comparable quality to a good digital minicamera so I don\'t have to carry both.  I think Nokia is on to something:  there may be a big market of people like me who will shell out serious bucks for a high quality well made camera-phone-computer to do everything they ever need to do plus take truly great pix, rather than just so they can be one with their peers at all times via Facebook and Twitter (which the N8 does very well if that\'s what you want).  We arent afraid of the slightly more complex Simbian OS than your average six year olds would want to learn. (I remember my first impression of an iPhone was seeing a six year old popping virtual bubbles on it, I was impressed that Apple was so clever to expand their profitability by playing to the little  kid market niche.)  The price of the N8 is rapidly dropping as Nokia has just announced a new 41 MP phone camera is coming out soon (also with the Simbian OS).  Can\'t imagine why you need 41 instead of 12, so grab the truly great Nokia N8 now.'),(122,'B003ZX7RL4','I have been using Nokia N8 for 1 year before writing this review. I have received many compliments from other people about this phone\'s awesome performance in camera & video quality as well as fast accurate GPS while driving across North America. The call quality, Bluetooth, WiFi, 3G speeds, battery life and speakerphone are very good. Another very convenient feature is you can connect this phone directly to a TV via a built-in HDMI port to watch videos/photos/playgames. HDMI out is a rare feature in most phones.I have shot photos using Nokia N8 with stunning detail from quarter mile away using an optical zoom lens (that you buy separately as an attachment for about $20).Make sure to apply the latest \"Belle\" software update/patch from Nokia\'s website.The built-in GPS works without cell tower signal and is very fast in recalculating even in remote areas. The best part is, it is completely voice guided turn-by-turn and there is no need to \"tap\" on the screen to get voice instructions. The Map database is so awesome and complete that you can pretty much download free map data from any continent.It seems many of the negative comments here on Amazon are from people who have not yet applied the latest \"Belle\" software update from Nokia, or who are new to smartphones in general or don\'t know how to use advanced features of this phone or haven\'t been patient enough to spend decent time to figure out how to use it properly or just have bad mobile phone carriers with poor signal reception.Nokia N8 is still recommended as an unlocked phone as long as one is committed to learn to use it properly.'),(123,'B003ZX7RL4','Mis comentarios del Telefono. Por lo general es muy poco el tiempo que tengo utilizando el tel&eacute;fono pero a medida que lo utilizo las aplicaciones y la operatividad del mismo me doy cuenta que es un tel&eacute;fono bueno.Una c&aacute;mara de alta definici&oacute;n, La conectividad es excelente con USB, la salida HDMI a la TV fant&aacute;stica as&iacute; como tambi&eacute;n el sonido. Lo puedo utilizar para movistar, Movilnet en Venezuela con redes 3G, as&iacute; como tambi&eacute;n en Telcel de M&eacute;xico.

AWESOME Right? The problem is that now that I need to replace the battery the people from Nokia Center are telling my phone didnt have the genuine battery (no hologram) and guess what? I CANT REPLACE IT!!! Because the tape came on itself and no battery out. Except for opening it all...which of course is going to be more expensive and maybe impossible because it just wont come apart...I paid full price almost or more than 600USD , I just don\'t understand why didn\'t they provide me with a genuine N8 battery... cheap decisions....bad review on fullfillers. So be careful Afterawhile those cheap batteries become really expensive... I may even have to consider getting a new phone after 3 years because of the battery even I dont want to, I normally use my cellphones for 5 years or more, since the most I need them for if calling and texting.Im really upset. Not the same to but a battery than a complete cellphone. And something similar and reliable its another 600USD which I cant afford at the moment so Im using my plan without any calls.... :('),(125,'B003ZX7RL4','This is an update to the earlier review.  The product now ships with Anna and maybe Belle but is easily upgraded.  There is even some third-party upgrades that bring this phone into 2013.  I purchased it in April 2013 as a replacement to an earlier N8 that I had damaged.  BUT: I Originally ordered a Nokia 808.  It had a defective memory card-slot. I then ordered three N8s.  Two were defective in that the HDMI output didn\'t work, the third had a defective camera shutter button.  I ordered a fourth one from PUT Group after writing them to make sure they weren\'t a business operating under the same name as the other four companies.  Prompt response, helpful information and a promise that I could return it if there was a problem. This N8 is fine.  PUT Group is an excellent source to buy the phones.  The same cannot be said for XIV Wireless, My Wish-List and  Hassle-Free Cell.  I\'m not complaining about their service.  They promptly refunded my purchase. Maybe I just got lucky with PUT but there seems to be some consistent issues with Nokia quality control so make sure you can return the phone if it fails to work.  And check out ALL the functions of the phone before ripping apart the packaging.  It\'s still a great phone but I\'m totally disappointed with Nokia quality control or the way that some resellers are handling their products.First I must say this is a terrific phone.  Consider buying for all the reasons you\'ve read.  But don\'t buy it until Nokia releases the Anna (and preferably the Belle) operating system update.  The current one is a bit buggy.  Much of the rest of the world has received the update but Nokia in their wisdom has not (as of September 20, 2011) released it for US versions.  There is even some suggestion that the US will not ever get the update since Nokia wants to push their upcoming Microsoft products.  Until Nokia releases Anna and Belle you should stay away from this phone.  For that matter you should consider their customer service attitude toward US customers when you considering buying any Nokia phone.  They just don\'t seem to care about their existing customers - at least those in North America.  Phone calls to their support and customer service result in evasion and disinformation about the upgrade.  They have lost the confidence of many of us Nokia users.'),(126,'B003ZX7RL4','Bought this a few months ago, no problems so far.I don\'t use my phone for anything other than: calls, texts, photos, gmail, facebook, internet and the occasional gps.  It does the job for my purposes and the battery life is excellent, which is very important to me. The camera is very good, especially in low light.  I bought it in part because it is supposed to have good global gps, and I am anticipating travel to Europe this year for work, so hopefully it lives up to my expectations.My last phone was an n97 that threw up all over itself and died one day after 3 years of faithful service.  I appreciated the similarities this phone has to the n97 in terms of user interface, I was able to learn it very quickly.  If it lasts me 3 years I will be very happy.'),(127,'B003ZX7RL4','What can I say. The phone is same as the N80 that I bought in 2005. A few extra features do not make this phone $450. Also the same GLITCHES I had on my N80 are on the N8. I used my N80 for about 7 months before it stopped working complitely so I really hope the N8 will last longer. NOT MANY USEFULL APLICATIONS at all. Because my wife doesnt understand much in phones she didnt want to return it because she thinks its a nice looking phone (and it really is a good looking for) but I really wanted to return it. Basicaly the phone is OK but NOT for $450. All is worth is $300 the most and thats because its a touch screen and has 16GB internal memory.'),(128,'B003ZX7RL4','The phone connects to wifi but it can\'t surf the web with wifi. Setting up the wifi is a huge problem. You need to organize your access points, destinations etc etc..it\'s so unpractical. After working hours on this the result is a failure. Searching through the internet with my laptop, youtube etc all the advises did do nothing. Changing the browser defaults giving priority to wifi over 3G..you name it. It connects to my home wifi but the browser can\'t connect to a web site. I\'m not a fan of Steve Jobs or over polished Apple products. But hands down, he knew Psychology. Steve Jobs knew how to design a product so that it would be a piece of cake to set things up and ready to go. This is the problem of Nokia. It seems engineers designed the N8. Engineers who think about every detail but completely ignore the realities of human psychology. Who would know terms like \"access point\", \'WEP\" \"WAC\"? It\'s Nokia\'s job to electronically design a product so that a user would press a few buttons and get to the internet. I command anyone to google \"Nokia N8 wifi problems\" before purchasing this cell phone. It\'s a mess. I have an Ipod touch. On the day I received it I set the wifi over minutes. Nokia cannot survive in this hard battle without knowing psychology and intuition of users. I am returning this cell phone.UPDATE: I sat down with Nokia in a live chat for hours. They couldn\'t fix it. The phone can\'t create an access point for Wifi. They asked me to return it to Amazon.'),(129,'B003ZX7RL4','This phone has an endless list of features. I will not go into the features I have already read on other reviews.- Tethering out of the box with an app included in the phone.- Super fast face detection (focusing and metering)- Very responsive screen- The old composite video cable works on the headphones jack (as well as the HDMI)- It may not have a retina display, but videos seem very crisp and vibrant.- GPS lock and compass calibration was very fast.The things I disliked:- Like everyone else the UI is not state of the art, there is much room for improvement here.- Mail for exchange did not properly work on an initial sync.- The social network app is terrible.Overall the phone is great for techies who love to have many features that are software locked on other platforms.'),(130,'B003ZX7RL4','I purchased 3 of them in February for my wife, my son, and I.  I have pushed the phone to the point of defect.  I have loaded and experimented with many apps. My home page is loaded with updates for my social networks, current news, and weather updates. I also have a dedicated home page for 5 emails set to the quickest update interval. I then purchased a program called RAMblow Pro.  It\'s a memory management program which closes unused apps for you.  Its similar to the memory programs offered on Android\'s app store.  I love this phone and all its capabilities. Its the best camera phone ever. Great replacement to my limited HTC Aria.I am also a former N97 and N95-8gb owner'),(131,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought  defective Nokia N8 here at Amazon and tried to get it repaired. Filled up the required form and waited for shipping labels for a week. The phone is under warranty. The phone kept on restarting and becoming an annoying piece of crap. The shipping labels should be sent to me via e-mail but waited for nothing. So called customer support and directed to a call center in the Philippines(the only one they have)It could have been pleasant bec. the response was quick and promised me they will provide me the items I need to get it shipped for repair.Waited for hours and checked e-mails, hours become days with no answer. Made a follow up e-mail to US support and received an apology for the inconvenience. But I don\'t want any excuses all I need is to get this phone shipped for repair. Then I get a message from Nokia to call a specialist to take care of my problem,her name was Joyce and spoke to her and she promised to take care of my problem and assured me she will personally e-mail me the shipping label  to get my phone shipped. She promised me she will do a follow up call to make sure I received the things that I need to get it shipped, unluckily the Nokia phone I was using restarted and ended our conversation. I waited again for the promised shipping instructions but they lied to me again. Called back Joyce the next day and my called was received by her co-worker and assured me my call will be returned.But no return call from her.

All colors were very impressive but I went with the blue.  My wife, who was not in the market for a phone, saw the green one and wanted it immediately.  So we have two.  My prior phone was a Nokia N900 which I used for a little over a year.  I really liked the N900 but decided to try the N8 because it appeared the Maemo software on the N900 was turning into more of an Nokia experiment.  I could be wrong but enhancements and upgrades for that phone seemed unlikely.  Most of our friends have IPhones so for just that reason we didn\'t want one.The N8 was a very impressive surprise.  The looks and design make it cross into a more elegant catagory.  It\'s kind of like taking off an average looking wrist watch and replacing it with a Rolex or Omega.Below are the pros and cons.Pros:1.  The size (particularly the width) and weight are perfect for using one hand to perform functions.  The width of many popular smart phones make one handed use awkward.  Also the phone is all aluminum, a fact that distinguishes it from 99% of the competition whose phones are all plastic.  This is a visable and tangible difference, one you definately feel when you pick up this phone.2.  The glass is a special material (gorilla glass)and we\'ve noticed that occaisional miscues that might have put small permanent marks or  scratches on our other screens don\'t faze this one.  We purchased Zagg protective film but decided not to use it unless it becomes necessary.3.  For calls and music, my N900 had two separate speakers and the sound was very good.  The one speaker on the N8, actually sounds better and is much louder.4.  As noted by others, the photos and videos taken with this phone are in a class of their own.  The end product is superior to most dedicated cameras.5.  Battery life:  For both my wife and I, who are middle of the road users, the battery lasts a solid two days and even more depending on the usage.  We typically charge on the third day.  I was charging every night with the N900.  As a side note, the N8 has an attractive analog clock and day/date screen saver that we leave on all the time and it seems to have little or no effect on battery life.6.  This is a small item, but the N8 provides the means to have a wrist strap.  I typically put the phone in my pants pocket with the wrist strap in position to grab when I hear the ring.  I got used to this on the N900 after a few months and found it very handy to use in many situations.7.  When you press and hold down the \"call\" button, you are prompted to say the name of the contact you wish to call.  The N8 brings up that contact, along with others that may have the same sounding name.  If you don\'t interrupt the process, the selected contact is called.  This is not a hit and miss thing.  For the most part, it\'s pretty accurate particularly as you become more familiar with what the phone likes to hear.  This same voice command also works for calling up applications.8.  There is a feature that will record phone conversations.  This recorder can be used for any purpose, business meetings, family arguments etc.9.  There is a second camera on the screen side of the phone for use with applications like Skype.10.  All of the on board applications perform as expected or better in some cases.  As far as we are concerned, all the hype about symbian being inferior to \"whatever\" is just that, hype.  Personally, I feel a very high percentage of users do not enter into a zone where using symbian is going to hamper their use of a smart phone.11.  Along with the typical useless programs, Ovi store also has several good ones.  For example, we loaded \"Swype\" which is a text entering program.  On the virtual keyboard, you move your finger across the keyboard and without lifting your finger, stop at the letters you want.  After you\'ve completed the word, you lift your finger and the word is inserted into the text.  A little hard to explain but it\'s pretty cool.  Another one is \"Own Voice\" which is a program where you record your voice as the one that gives GPS instructions.  i.e.  \"Turn left...no no, your other left.\"12.  I guess it goes without saying that as a phone, Nokia has always been a little ahead of the curve and the N8 is no exception.  Reliable excellent call quality and ease of use.On the con side:1.  It seems to me that the camera lens should be covered when not in use.  It hasn\'t really been an issue with us but it just looks like something that should have been addressed.2.  The speaker slot is located in the camera lens housing which protrudes out from the phone.  If the phone is tipped just slightly forward when laying on a table, the speaker slot gets blocked off and a ringing phone will not be heard.  The difference between hearing and not hearing the phone is only about 1/32 of an inch from the phone being perfectly flat.  The Nokia silicone cover emiminates this issue.3.  I found the Nokia Ovi Suite for the PC something of a challenge.  Not exactly user friendly.  Loading programs was cumbersome and a lot of the times didn\'t work.  I found the majority of the problems I encountered were due to me not using the correct procedure or starting from the right screen.  However, I also found that making a mistake was usually the only way to effectively get the correct procedure.  In any case, there\'s been an update and between that update and me learning about what not to do, things seem better.So in conclusion, Both my wife and I feel the N8 is an exceptional smart phone.  Stylish, functional and elegant.Update:  I\'ve had the N8 for 8 months now and must say it continues to be amazing.  I\'ve had no problems of any kind.  Even though I\'ve been pulling it in and out of my front pants pocket the whole time, there is not one mark on the gorilla glass.  Looks like it did when new.  It\'s overall handsome exterior still grabs admiring comments.  I back-up my data frequently because if I was to lose this phone, I would definately get another N8.  I\'ve seen the new E7 with the slide-out qwerty keyboard and although very similar and tempting, it\'s missing the FM transmitter and the wrist strap holes like the N8.  Also, I\'ve been told that although the E7 screen measures larger, the actual display is only slightly bigger than that of the N8.'),(135,'B003ZX7RL4','This phone lasted for exactly one week. After a couple of days i noticed it would freeze for 1 second here and there but i thought no biggie. After a week, the phone completely froze on me, could not power off, and you cannot remove the internal battery without a screwdriver so i had to wait over an hour for it to be able to restart it. Once the phone booted up again, all my settings on my phone was reverted.KEYBOARD? 0 starsI never got used to the phone. Yes it does have swype, BUT only horizontally. Whats the point of swype in that position? its not like you can swype with 2 fingers to make words. So your stuck with typing out words without auto-text, and with a screen keyboard thatl make you retype words. If you wanna try to get comfortable typing like this be my guest.Overall feel? 0 starsI tried very hard to like this phone. I gave it lots of chances. I think i was too amazed by the 12 megapixel camera attached to it that i decided to stay with the phone. But in the end if you don\'t count the camera, the phone is not great. Maybe the phone being faulty was a godsend. Heres to hoping amazon refunds.P.S.Theres a reason why most people use typically the same type of phone, and its because its reliable. Check out nokias website, they admit they produced faulty nokia n8\'s and they SAY that everythings okay now, but you\'ve been warned.'),(136,'B003ZX7RL4','I had wanted to make the move to a smartphone for almost a year. I wanted it to be a Nokia, but my carrier did not have them. So I waited till the price was right and purchased mine from Amazon. Nokia.com refers you to Amazon to make the purchase. I did not not want to jump on the iphone bandwagon. I wanted a phone I could use with my existing carriers plan without signing up for another contract. I have the unlimited $10 internet plan, the slow plan for non??? smart phones. It does everything I want to do. I get to connect by wifi for faster speeds. The camera is awesome. The GPS and maps are great. It does everything all the good reviews said it would do and I have not seen the problems others complain about. I have had it for a month now without any major problems. Like most computers, it requires an occasional restart, once or twice a week if I have been multitasking a lot. The apps are not as numerous as iphone, not something I needed. It comes with QuickOffice and will read Word, and Excel files. It is a basic version so I upgraded to the Pro version for $9.99, and it was well worth it. It will also open PDF files. Being able to use a 32g microSDHC card for the camera is wonderful. I know some reviewers said it is an iphone killer, well, it is no iphone, but I did not want an iphone, my wife has one and if that is what you want then buy it, but if you are looking for a nice sturdy phone, with a nice camera, free offline maps and basic internet to facebook, email, txt surf the web etc, then buy this.  If you want to hop on the phone carrier service you can still do that as well. They will always take your money. If you buy it from Amazon, you can now use your American Express and Discover points toward your purchases, so save up some points and let them help reduce the price.

LOL...Symbian, has been worked on.. I just wonder, what if Nokia had spend more time working on symbian than wasting time on maemo and meego.. how greater could it be..PLEASE NOKIA DO NOT GET RID OF SYMBIAN, INVEST MORE TIME AND WORK ON IT.. KEEP IT GOING ON..Also, GPS, which is a great feature... trust me, in this phone you will have anything you need for communicating, gaming on the go, listening to your fav music, watching movies, series and more, taking pics and videos whenever you want.CONSMaybe just one desing flaw... stereo speakers for this phone are placed on the same spot... which makes not a lot of sense, why couldn\'t them be on the sides like the n900 or both on oposites sides on the same face like the n82.ConclusionAs of today July 2011, you cannot get a better phone for the price/quality/greatness/support/features as the Nokia N8.'),(146,'B003ZX7RL4','Had an experience of using both iphone 4 and Nokia N8 phone; While iphone 4 is unbeatable interms of some of the features like the amazing \"Retina\" display etc., Nokia N8 stands out just because of the flexibility it offers; To simply put - it gives me much more freedom while using the phone - in terms of basic functions which a common (smart phone) user like me does..- Got a good song to hear - just DOWNLOAD it (instantly) to your phone - to play it whenever you want (even when no network - or without worrying about the Datacharges)- Copy files to & from the Nokia device - without the need to rely on the proprietory utilities - You do not even need a computer to transfer - it allows transfer to Pen-drives directly using the supplied cables- Carry the phone to anypart of the world - without the headache of unlocking or breaking the version etc.,- Gives me flexibility to have 48 GB memory with no extra cost..- To listen to music using the amazing headphones (that comes along with the device) is truly great - I feel like listening the songs from a theater.- MOST IMPORTANT - the 12 MP in-built camera - WOW! what an amazing feature - this device is awesome in the pictures..- the advantage of Nokia - interms of Sturdy nature, long battery time - are all there - unsung...On top of these - after using the symbian OS in the earlier smart phones like the Nokia E71 - I am getting a much surprising stunning experience while using the OS in Nokia N8 - Dowload speeds is really admirable;I am very happy with this device and more happy that I have returned the iphone 4 - within the 30 day return period'),(147,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ve had this phone for 2 months. The camera is great, as advertised; I used it on a trip to Europe and didn\'t regret not bringing a digital camera. The reception and voice quality are excellent -- far better than my iPhone 3GS. The GPS works offline with voiceover turn-by-turn directions and OVI maps for visuals. Very good calendar with integrated To-Dos. The recent Symbian Anna update has made the OS a bit more user friendly, although it\'s still far from iOS.Overall, this is a very good smartphone. Its main deficiencies are limited and somewhat clunky apps. But I don\'t need a phone for slick apps -- I have an iPad. This gives me what I was looking for: good telephony, great camera, free GPS, unlocked phone that works on all U.S. and European GSM networks.'),(148,'B003ZX7RL4','I used this phone for over a year.

This phone has 1 feature that is only present in a handful of phones in the world!!!This phone will broadcast to an FM frequency of your choosing directly. This phone has a built in FM transducer!The Nabigation was awesome, the apps were great. Nokia just did not make it future proof enough and the symbian OS is quite dated. The screen was big enough to watch videos, make calls but not for imersive gaming. Battery life was quite good and the screen\'s colors were awesome.12 MP camera blows most current phones out of the water.Voice quality was the best I\'ve heard of any phone I\'ve had for the last 5 years. Including the samsungs.The exterior was beautiful, brushed aluminum finish in GREEN! Loved it, upgraded to an SIII after I could not keep defending the Symbian OS anymore as android had killed everything else.Still if you\'re on a budget or traveling abroad and can\'t get your phone unlocked, this is a great phone to have.'),(149,'B003ZX7RL4','I have been using this phone for less than 10 days and it freezes and reboots constantly.  I understand the software is buggy and would be better if I could install the Anna update but Nokia Suite and OTA is saying my firmware is up to date so I cannot get Anna now.  I knew the phone would have problems but I was confident that nokia would let me update the software so i made the purchase. I\'m considering flashing the anna update myself, does anyone know what is the most recent version I should look for?  If I exchange through Amazon can they replace with a phone that has Anna preinstalled or is it just luck?It would have been a sweet phone if it worked. Nokia support sucks.Update:Jan 11,2011I took another reviewer\'s advice and got a replacement from amazon.  I was a little scared as the phone had the same product code 059D0V2 but alas Anna was on there preinstalled.  All it needed was a small update ver. 25.008 to fix an issue with USA T-mobile 3G and then I installed the other Anna packages 1/2 and 2/2. I am happy now and the phone is working well, so far.4 stars'),(150,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ve used Nokia smartphones for awhile now starting with the E63. This is the first N series I have used. I also use a Google Nexus One and thought I would leave Nokia behind. I decided to replace my E72 (my work phone)with another hardware qwerty phone but AT&T really didn\'t have a suitable replacement. Where I work, AT&T has the strongest and most reliable signal. I was planning on waiting for the Nokia E7 but the price was a bit much. I took the plunge and ordered the N8 back in February thinking I could return it if I didn\'t like it. When I received the phone I was surprised at how good it looked. The press and blog photos don\'t do this phone justice, it is a sleek and handsome phone.The build quality puts most other phones to shame. Set up was straight forward and easy. I was up and running in minutes. I use Nokia\'s ovi service and synced my contacts and everything OTA. Nokia did a great job with symbian^3. It is fluid, fast and intuitive. There is a slight learning curve if you are not used to symbian but I experienced a similar learning curve with android. This is a big step up from symbian 1. The camera is great as the reviews have said. I thought I would miss the hardware keyboard but I found myself typing just as fast on the (according to the tech blogs) \"substandard\" on screen qwerty. I couldn\'t understand this because I struggled with the Nexus One even with swiftkey. The reason for this I think is that Nokia\'s touch screen is of a higher quality and thus more accurate than the N1.I installed swype and I love it. The only thing I miss (being a USA user) are local apps. No apps for programing my dvr etc. Nokia has released things like \"Sleeping Screen\" and other useful apps for this phone and a large UI upgrade is in store for summer. This phone has pushed aside my Nexus as my main phone.'),(151,'B003ZX7RL4','I purchased this Nokia N8 because I wanted a cell phone with a great camera for traveling. After using it for one week, I am pleased with it.Pros:1. Great camera which takes awesome pictures and HD video2. Great signal strength compared to iPhone3. Great GPS and maps4. Wi-fi5. Lots of data storage space, but I added another 16Gig to get it up to 32Gig6. Easy to sync with my computer using Ovi Suite7. Unlocked for use on any network using a SIM8. Stable OS9. Nice desktop options for favorite contacts, missed calls, received texts, Facebook comments, search box, etcCons:1. Not as easy to use as the iPhone which is so intuitive2. Fewer apps available3. Most tasks require an extra step, touch of the screen, necessary on the iPhoneOverall, this is a great cell phone and I am happy with my purchase. I may continue to use my iPhone as an iPod Touch and keep using my Nokia N8 as my main cell phone.

Ever since I got the N95 I was hooked. Then I got the N97 and it was a total disaster. Constant freeze ups, totally unusable web browser, and horrible battery. All the while I would always return to my Iphone which I\'ve considered to be the best phone ever made. Ive had my Nokia N8 for about 2 week now and I can say......that this is the best phone Nokia has ever made. The construction of the phone is industrially elegant, with amazing lines and a very beautiful screen. Don\'t be fooled by the low resolution compared to the Iphone, this screen is BEAUTIFUL, and pictures, movies are bright vivid and super sharp. I have the Iphone 4 now and honestly I think the colors are better on the Nokia N8. The most impressive part of this phone is that camera. Pics are insanely beautiful and I don\'t mean they are great for a camera phone. They are great PERIOD. I would put this up against my Nikon D60 DSLR camera and it would be hard to tell the difference. I have several high end digital cameras and the N8 performs amazingly in bright light as well in low light. I went out to a club last night, and it was pretty dim. With the xenon flash the pics were super clear, bright, and sharp with no fogging or graininess you would typically see on an Iphone 4 in a dark environment. The macro mode is TERRIBLE though. Close up shots about 4 to 5 inches away are a blurry mess. The Iphone 4 however takes AMAZING close up shots. This was a complete surprise to me as I thought the N8 would take super sharp close up shots. Ok moving on to the battery. What can i say....if your using the phone for internet, calls, and Facebook  that battery is ok and will last you from 8am to 5 or 6pm, pretty typical of a smart phone. However once you start taking pics with the flash on that battery gets sucked dry in about 60-70 pics which is cool for a night out, however you pretty much have to have the phone charged up before you hit the town. Then again I run wifi on, bluetooth on, and screen brightness on full at all times, so im sure you can get more juice of it than me. The pics and videos that play on the phone are super sharp and have great color. Ok now moving on to where this phone gets starts off speeding up the hill but ends up getting stuck in the mud. The internet experience is better than the N97. Its faster for sure, however when you click links the screen doesn\'t always respond the first time. I ofter have to press multiple times. Also when a page loads, its a bit slower than the Iphone 4 but on wifi they are about the same.. Scrolling is ok and kinda laggy Pinch to zoom works well. There is no youtube client for the phone, just a link that takes you to the youtube.com website. Youtube videos are horribly laggy and jerky and not even worth using unless you like constant stopping and stuttering in audio and video. Im sure they will come out with a native Youtube client soon, or if not, that would just plain suck. I use youtube a lot. The Ihone 4 kills the N8 in the youtube experience. The sound from the ONE speaker is actually pretty nice. Doesn\'t sond tinny. Sound is mid ranged with focus in the higher frequency spectrum. Lows are only apparant when you use headphones. The headphones that come with it are not bad but nothing you\'ll be impressed with. Iphone headphones are much better.  I use a pair of 15$ seinnheisers and they sound amazing. Bluetooth with this phone is the best I have ever seen. I am typing this review using an Apple bluetooth keayboard with my Nokia N8 and its an amazingly simple and easy thing to do. It works GREAT. I hooked up my N8 to the HDMI on my LCD TV, and what can i say. I was blown away. I played pics I took at a night club and the sample videos that it comes with and they look like Blueray quality on my TV 1080p kind of quality. Really amazing. The radio transmitter works very well and pulls in stations with no distortion. reading ebooks on this thing is just a pure headache. Im not even going to get into that......Ill stick to my Iphone 4 and Ipad for that.  Ok, I almost forgot the 2nd best thing about this phone. The navigation is FANTASTIC. I have Tom Tom on my Iphone - garbage. I have a magellan GPS - ok. I have a Pioneer N3 navigation deck in my Landcruiser- awesome. I would say the navigation is just as good as the pioneer navigation which is ALWAYS spot on. The free voice giuded navigation that says all the street names is great. and you can download for free EVERY language you can think of. Trust me.....They are all there no matter how oscure. I even downloaded a surfer guys voice that makes lame jokes. Playing games on the N8 is a joke. Games are violently laggy, jerky, and overall TERRIBLE. I give the game playing ability 2 stars compared to 10 stars to the Iphone. Dont get this phone if you want to play games, you would be able to. The Nokia OVI store is still the same useless thing it was back in the days of the N97, There were like 5 useful applications I could download for free. Everything else is either COMPLETELY useless or just some lame theme you have to pay for. You know with all the shortcomings of this phone, I like it a lot. I love the camera, GPS, and HDMI output. However the internet browsing, game playing are like 5 years behind the times, which will make this a secondary phone for me to take with me when i go out to clubs, bars, or travel the world so I can use the amazing xenon flash, and GPS. The Iphone will still be my primary phone. Come on Nokia you have such a great phone, why cant you just redesign a new operating system? Symbian is terribly outdated. Well thats all I got. Hope you can make an informed decision about this phone.'),(154,'B003ZX7RL4','I just bought this phone a couple days ago.Comparing N8 photos vs iPhone photos:- iPhone screen is 960x640, while N8 screen is 360x640.- A picture when enlarged will look more blurry on the N8, compared with the same picture enlarged on the iPhone.- This doesn\'t mean the N8 camera takes blurry pictures.- This means the screen resolution is better on iPhone- This means the camera is better on N8.The bad quality UI complaints are mostly due to the 3rd party widgets included from YouTube, CNN, BBC, National Geographic, Paramount movie previews.My phone crashed (UI got stuck) due to some third party app, and I tried to remove the battery (as with most other phones) but couldn\'t.I realized I did not need to remove the battery...just press the power button for 5-8 seconds and the phone will reboot.BTW, if you\'d ever need to replace the battery yourself, just use a small \"allen key\" type screwdriver.The Nokia N8 multiple home screens are a great way to organize yourself and reduce phone screen clutter.If you need a portrait mode qwerty keyboard, swype or dayhand maybe interesting options for you.I personally need a qwerty keyboard in portrait mode.Keep in mind that qwerty keyboard is just a burden for most people (esp. older people in Asia).Such people will be content with just reading messages, sending a few \"very short\" messages with the T9 keypad...while making a lot of calls and taking a lot of pictures anytime anywhere.Among the things I love about this phone:1. N8 is able to play all sorts of vdo file formats.2. Camera gives you 12MP pictures, and HD video! Just make sure to peel the plastic off the lens on the back.3. Connectivity cables included (usb to thumb drive, usb to pc/mac, hdmi to tv is flawless)4. Multi-tasking5. Long battery life6. Internet, Email, or Web Connectivity can be set to be via \"WLAN only\" or \"WLAN preferred\" or \"3G only\", etc.You can minimise mobile operator fees as you like.7. Combine Push Email with your choice of network connectivity via WLAN and you start to save money with the lower phone bill.This is my opinion on the iPhone vs N8 issue...- US journalists/bloggers who write N8 reviews are mostly new to Nokia/Symbian.So they will only \"evaluate\" their comfort level with the N8...for just a couple of days.They admit (very briefly) that \"I\'m an iPhone user, I tried to use N8 for x days\", before they start hammering the N8.- N8 gives you the gear to lower your phone bill- Hackers have traditionally been about lowering their AT&T; phone bills. Many in Silicon Valley, including Steve Jobs, grew up with this mentality. Nokia probably realize this and gives you a choice...the press is not giving Nokia the credit for giving you the freedom.- Nokia N8 robust hardware will still be handy after many years of use and software updates.Part of the \"UI problem\" is due to the less tightly structured Symbian UI development kit, by allowing 3rd party developers the freedom to create their own look and feel.So each app on Symbian can have a different UI structure and user\'s experience may not very be consistent across different apps even though they are using the same device (N8).The less tight structure of Symbian APIs has proved to be a strength as Symbian has evolved to support a much larger variety of hardware types with different phone form factors:- some touch screen- some T9 keypad- some qwerty keypadNokia, as a leading phone manufacturer, offers a larger choice of phone form factors for a larger customer base...that\'s the reason Nokia is a leading phone manufacturer.Each form factor will be preferred by different types of users, since there is a much wider consumer base.Many business users will prefer a qwerty keyboard.Many users will prefer a T9 keypad and find the qwerty keyboard a distraction with too many buttons...for example, they usually do not do a lot of texting or type on a computer keyboard.Many people like the \"feel\" of a touch UI...but that also means that each app is more likely to have \"touch buttons\" on a different location of the screen.That means touch UI phones require the users to \"look before you touch\".That means with the keyboard or keypad, users can \"feel\" as they \"touch\" the phone buttons without looking.'),(155,'B003ZX7RL4','This phone has some incredible features at this unlocked, off contract price.  This is a 3G pentaband WORLD phone which will work on both AT&T and T-Mobile. It has a 12MP camera with a CCD sensor 3 times bigger than iPhone 4 and even larger than purpose built high quality camera\'s like the Panasonic LUMIX ZS-3.  It has a Xenon flash for excellent night time shots.  The N8 shoots HD 720p with HDMI and DOLBY Surround sound output!  The camera\'s optics are specially designed and made by Carl Zeiss, and it has AutoFocus and a mechanical shutter for big camera capabilities in a compact form factor.  The phones body is a single piece of Anodized, scratch resistant Aluminum, with Gorilla glass front.  It has a new generation AMOLED display with anti-reflective layer.  The N8 also sports BLuetooth 3.0, so you can use a wireless bluetooth keyboard and mouse simultaneously.  It also has USB on-the-go, so you can directly use mass storage devices like a hard drive or USB flash memory.  The phone has the latest Symbian^3 OS, with multi-touch, actual multi-tasking and avoids the double tapping of older Symbian versions.  The software also includes on-board and robust photo and video editing.  The N8 also uses a faster GPU than the iPhone 4 (SOC GPU), called the Broadcom BMC2727, for a great gaming experience which you can also pipe directly to an HD TV and play on the big screen.  It also comes with free turn by turn navigation, available in 74 countries. Of course, its a Nokia so Video Call capability is a given.  Battery life is exceptional.'),(156,'B003ZX7RL4','There are goods and bads of the phone. The build quality is definitively its strong point. And the camera.... oh my god. its just absolutely amazing. Blows away my point and shoots and is miles ahead of the camera on my nexus one. It come close to me DSLR, but not quite. The most frustrating things about the phone is the web browser and the on screen keyboard.First the keyboard. It just plain sucks. Hopefully sywpe will be release soon and fix this. No portrait keyboard and text prediction is horrible.Second, web browser. Coming from an Android browser... you get spoiled. The symbian web browser was once the king of the hill, but its showing its age now. Again rumor has it a new browser is coming out. Opera may be a good alternative, but I personally do not like it.I may return the N8 to nokia and wait for a new keyboard/browser to come out before committing the full $500+ on this phone. Its definitely a worthy competitor to my Nexus one and I\'m having a hard time deciding which phone to keep. It all comes down to software vs. hardware.'),(157,'B003ZX7RL4','I have to say that before buy this one, my initial idea was to take one cheaper, more executive style like the Blackberry models (E71 for instance).I\'m such a person that take long time to analyze every aspect from a product. Just to you have an idea of what I\'m saying, I spent at least four weeks analyzing a bunch of alternatives to this phone not limited to the smartphones category.Finally, I decided for N8 for the following reasons:1 - The well known Nokia battery lifetime (just don\'t wanted to pick an Apple/Moto and need daily charges (I use to charge once a week, low usage of course);2 - The camera, I thought: now we have an acceptable one that somehow can be a regular camera substitute (real substitute, take a look at the macros!);3 - GPS for free, period!4 - High end specs such as Bluetooth 3.0, amazing sound quality, wide range operating frequencies, USB on the go, Amoled, data modem, RDS, etc.5 - HDMI out. The possibility to run a HD video from a small piece of hardware into a wide LCD is just exciting!To be perfect:- Could have a ISDN digital signal, such as Galaxy S;- The camera could have a optical zoom;- Browser is the poorly one (can be fixed with updates);- Doesn\'t have a vertical keyboard (updates please);- Although the battery is great, it could be a dream with a 1800mAh (ok, now I\'m overreacting);Well, in my point of view, we\'re very near from a complete hand entertaining system, and this product is the closest one.My preferred word: convergency (all in one)!I\'m very happy with that!'),(158,'B003ZX7RL4','I received this phone on 4/10/2013. My goal was to find a reasonable unlocked phone with exceptional camera if possible. This one fit my needs with it\'s excellent Carl Zeiss optics and more powerful Xenon flash. I only use this device for it\'s phone, camera, texting, calendar and sometimes email. For email and Internet I use my laptop. It is a dated phone but was top of the line when it came out in the fall of 2010. The Nokia N8 has an attractive aluminum case and Carl Zeiss 12 MP optics camera with Xenon flash. It has a Gorilla Glass screen which specs don\'t mention. The price was a big factor as well, I bought it from Amazon Warehouse deals. This phone even had all the protective plastic covers on and all cables in original box--everything in perfect condition.Update 4/12/2013: Before even getting used to the new phone I installed the Belle upgrade which is much simpler to understand. After sorting out all the new features of Belle I have my phone designed the way I want it now. With Belle up to 6 home screens are available with a finger push, plus instant access to all menu items. Everything is accessable with out digging. Very impressive.Update 9/15/2013 I have come to enjoy having an excellent 12 megapix camera with me at all times and not have to remember to take the regular one. So if your prioritiy is an excellent phone and camera with the bonus of zenon flash at a good price this is it. I didn\'t want a mini laptop disguised as a large phone. The free Belle upgrade is a must, makes this phone exceptional. If you want to impress everyone you can load up 6 home screens but Why? Since having it for 5 months I have deceided I only want 3 home screens.  I use it\'s full featured calender every day. I ordered and received a second N8 in June for my wife and got a better deal then the first one. Amazon Prime delivered both phones on time and in excellent condition.A minus note--the battery can go down unexpectedly sometimes. Rebooting seems to correct that problem. To save the battery I close all applications when not in use. I have installed the free Nokia battery monitor to keep close tabs on the battery. Would I still buy this cell phone--yes.'),(159,'B003ZX7RL4','I moved to London, in a hurry, saw this phone on the daily deal and bought it, after making sure it would work on the UK mobile system. It was, and is, my first smartphone. My Verizon CDMA dumb phone isn\'tcompatible with EU networks. But I was in a hurry and didn\'t do my research.Comments:-I found an unexpected plethora of mobile phone carrier selection. Had I waited to get a phone until we arrived, I could have gotten a dumb phone for 17 including VAT and 10 usage credit. Pay as you go plans are plentiful and can be SIM only, phone & SIM, or one can get a US style plan.-I paid $300 for the N8 and saw it for sale at 300 (say close to $500) in London-however, I could never connect to the net except through wifi, don\'t know if it was the phone or the carrier-it was very tedious to text on a touchscreen after using thumbs on buttons, maybe a different phone or more experience would cure me-operating system was alien & counterintuitive. will get Android or Windows opsys for next smartphone-ringer was short & weak, dropped almost every call that came in. bad because incoming calls are free-vibrate mode also short & weak and no reminder buzzes-it is cute but that\'s not enough reason to buy when there are better choices out there****Later. I am positive the \'unhelpfuls\' are Nokia plants, as I was careful to lay out what I did and did not like about the phone. Manufacturers are getting aggressive about negative Amazon reviews, as was the case with a $2000 gaming computer my husband had that bricked at one month. It sat in repair shop for over a month, then was told 6 more weeks for computer co. to ship a hard drive. A computer company. The person in charge of low Amazon reviews found his review and the harddrive was overnighted and we now have a working laptop again. Of course I\'m sure computer company wants him to revise his review as a quid pro quo. And it\'s funny because I doubt this model N8 is still even being made by Nokia as it was a POS.'),(160,'B003ZX7RL4','I have owned and used this phone for 5 months. I was debating between 2 and 3 stars on this review.The pros: Good looks, sturdy design, responsive keyboard, Symbian OS may be outdated but saves on battery (if I don\'t use it heavily the battery lasts 3-4 days, which is impossible with iPhones), the GPS system has free map updates and works in remote areas, uses regular SIM card, not micro, there is a micro SD slot and the total memory of 16GB is upgradable to a whole 48 GB - rarely you have a phone with such a great storage capacity; the camera is very good with 12 megapixels and Carl Zeiss optics. It remains the phone with the best camera on the market. The Bluetooth works well.The cons: #1 shortcoming - the screen goes black and locks when you have to pick up a call, or when you initiate one. After all this is a PHONE, Nokia. It is hard to be unlocking the phone every time a call comes in. The same for an alarm. When it wakes you up, you can\'t just punch the \"snooze\" button, you have to unlock the phone\'s black screen by pushing down the side slide unlock button. BTW this problem affects a tremendous amount of N8\'s accross the world but Nokia seems to offer no solution or even recognition of the problem. 2. The phone does lock sometimes; 3. the \"Play via radio\" FM transmitter appears not to work. Although I\'ve tried it on various FM receivers it simply does not connect, although the phone screen says it is transmitting. People point out lack of half a million aps for Symbian OS but I use only 3-4 of those, and I have found those I need. So this is not really a shortcoming.Conclusion: N8 is a smart phone with many qualities however the unresponsive screen, and the other glitches makes it a sort of a dud. I am too conservative and do not like the harsh way the tech industry is pushing people to become insane consumers of ever \"improving\" new technology. I usually look for a phone that will last at lest 3 or more years, so I was hoping the Nokia N8 would cut it. It did not. I am a long time Nokia user and have been impressed with their simplicity, durability, competitive prices and versatility. Not this time around, sorry. I may be moving to another brand.'),(161,'B003ZX7RL4','Hello Everyone, I purchased Nokia N8 Symbian in the Mid of January 2011. I am really very much impressed and I LOVE this piece.

The manual will tell you to turn a screw to take off the back cover so that you could slide a SIM sleeve in an opening direction to insert the card. This is not the actual case. The instructions on the manual appear to be related to something entirely different. Good thing there\'s YouTube. Nothing to do with screws.Secondly, after I inserted the SIM card, charged the phone, and turned it on--after it loaded, it buzzed and turned off again. But when I removed the SIM card and turned the phone on--it worked. And it was wonderful.Until my third issue came up.The following link will take you to a photobucket album containing two pictures of a page. Both pictures are not all that great, but one is better than the other. The incredibly blurry one was taken by the NOKIA N8 phone that is supposedly 12 megapixels. The somewhat better picture was taken by a Samsung Sunburst with a 2 megapixel camera.[...]I was so excited for the phone, but after this mishap... I\'m just going to return it and wait until the 808 Pureview comes out in the US.'),(163,'B003ZX7RL4','I love the camera, takes great photos, the flash is functional. The navigation achieves satellite lock within a minute, even without a data plan.

Nokia does not care about Symbian, so Belle Refresh is not yet available for US N8\'s, even though international N8 got it almost as soon as it was released in Aug 2012. This is still a good unlocked phone, but I wish Nokia would support it better.Also, for any warranty repair, the phone has to be shipped back to Nokia, and they will take the full 10 business days before even attempting to contact you and shipping it back. I sent the phone in for battery life dropping rapidly, had to wait almost three weeks to get phone back. (and since Nokia did not have grey in stock for replacement phone, I had to get an orange)'),(164,'B003ZX7RL4','I would rate it as 4.5 stars if Amazon lets me.I have been using this phone for 3 weeks now. Before getting this phone I also considered getting an Android phone or upgrading to iPhone 4. I had an iPhone 3g before which is a great phone, but overall based on my top preferences I switched to Nokia N8. Of course I also thought about the price since the N8 gets no subsidies from any carrier, but I realized I can just sell whatever iPhone I get when I renew my contract (oh and the data plan is cheaper for the N8, please read on).CAMERA: #1 reason. I wasn\'t satisfied with iPhone\'s weak camera. Even my much older phone (2006 model) had 5mp and a flash! I also had an option to upgrade to iPhone 4 with 5mp camera to even it out, but 2010 that is below par compared to most high end phones. Besides, I also dont really like bringing my digital camera. I like to travel light and not worry about forgetting my camera. Top Andriod phones have 8mp, which by megapixel count would have been good enough for me. But I want something closer to a dedicated digital camera - which translates to Xenon flash and larger camera sensor size. Overall, picture quality is great. It takes 2-3 seconds to turn it on, which is just a bit slower to compact cameras.GPS Voice Navigation: It\'s free, as fast as my brother\'s Garmin to load and locate, and has turn-by-turn voice navigation. Google Maps is nowhere close to this. I am really bad at multitasking and the worst I can do is look at my phone or printed maps for directions while driving. Android has pretty good voice navigation too.DATA PLAN: I\'m with AT&T; right now and I dislike being forced to pay for smartphone data plan that I don\'t use! I unlocked my iPhone and installed something so it would use 0 data, but AT&T; still detected the iPhone regardless and began charging me. Maybe I did something wrong with the unlocking. Anyways, AT&T; doesnt recognize the N8 as a smartphone so I can either get $15 unlimited data plan or no data plan at all whenever I want. In the long run that saves $15 a month if either right now you are paying $30 right unlimited or $15 for data plan you dont use. x24 months if I had been on a 2 year contract. That\'s $360 total! Compensates for the big initial expense.The N8 has other good features such as great build quality (no cheap plastic feeling), penta band (when I go abroad), and HDMI out (which is super fun to use for games,  pictures, and movies). But overall the three above are my top reasons for buying it.However, despite all these great features, the N8 definitely falls behind with applications. There\'s the \"oh most iPhone and Android apps are junks anyways,\" but I could say the same about Nokia. I\'m not really an apps person, but I do miss most of the games from my iPhone. It\'s still a pretty new phone so hopefully new games would come out. At least N8 has Angry Birds... I wont give it 5 stars until more non-junk apps become available.In summary, if you want an all-in-one phone with great camera and GPS navigation and don\'t really care about applications and mobile internet, then this phone is perfect. But if you do a lot of gaming and social apps like Facebook, this phone might be disappointing.Hope this helps!'),(165,'B003ZX7RL4','Has a few issues Like software/phone freazes but otherwise a great phone.  I\'m using it so much wife says i\'m maried to it. No one can argue with the super pictures it takes even in pure darkness.  Takes better pictures than my $400 canon camera. Havn\'t tried the High Def vidio camera yet or the GPS much, but the feature that broadcasts your music to a radio is quit fun.  great for parties - record and play your own radio announcemts like \"this song is dedicated to... or happy birthday to...\"  May seem frustrating to use the phone at first until you get used to it, because there is soooo much to learn, to get used to, to set up, and apps to download, and all of these procedures take time and patience to learn.  Overall and so far after one month it seems worth the money to me.'),(166,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this Nokia N8 phone unlocked GSM phone as a birthday gift for my friend. Usage was below average. All of a sudden in October 2012, all the text messages are staying in outbox but not delivering. Called Nokia for fix and they couldn\'t fix the issue over phone. They asked us to send the phone to Florida to their Technical center. No follow up was from their part. Called again and all the calls are being answered from Philippines. They said the phone was send to Philippines since the center in Florida is closed. No follow up or information for another month...Today we called and we are told that they destroyed the phone without our consent!!My friend is without a phone for last two months. ( what a terrible birthday gift I chose!!!)Please do not buy this phone. The Nokia service team is lacking any customer service sense.'),(167,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ve lightly used the device for a couple of weeks now. Used for app development (Qt), mostly.I haven\'t found any of the hardware issues reported, thankfully.It takes a little while to get over the initial user interface \"shock\". It\'s clunky, slow at times, the various apps have completely different looks and feels. Qt-based apps for example cannot touch-scroll. Others are a full screen contraption of user elements unrelated to any standard design form a user reasonably would expect. Many pre-installed apps do not seem to work, or require elaborate configuration, although that can be a plus, considering how Android apps can reach right into your contact and other information for \"convenient\" sign-up.I still hate the plastic shells at the top and bottom, negating the good impression of the aluminum case but the SIP integration remains a highlight, and so is pentaband 3G on this SIM unlocked device. I also despise the USB port at the side of the device. Didn\'t like it on the Droid (one of the reasons not to buy one), and sure isn\'t appreciated here.Great speaker. The camera dome provides the right amount of separation from a flat surface to sound great. Loud rings, so it is suitable to double as a SIP-based house or office phone.Outstanding camera. Unless I want to shot specifically nice pictures, I can leave my digital camera at home. Huge plus for me, personally.One personal aspect here that\'s quite the relief from the Android device I\'ve recently used on a daily basis (NexusOne), is a reasonable assurance not to get \"spied on\" by Google like found on Android devices.Bottom line: Recommended only if you know what you\'re getting when buying a Symbian device. Keep your fingers crossed Nokia get their act together at the end of quality control and customer support, although that\'s asking a bit much of a devices that\'s north of $500 (now $400). This is 2010 and it\'s supposed to work right out of the box.'),(168,'B003ZX7RL4','I have had this phone for a week and I have not been disappointed.  To save space I will just add my endorsement to M. Nitouche\'s and Dirk\'s recent reviews.  I replaced my N82 with the gray N8.  I can only hope Nokia\'s Symbian house cleaning (as they go to Windows) will not keep them from fulfilling their promised PR2.0 OS upgrade.  The phone is stable, but the many reviewers have pointed out a few things the next OS release needs to do.  I will repeat one thing many others have said:  Don\'t get this phone if you don\'t want to learn something in order to adjust it to be the way YOU want.  This is great a great phone.'),(169,'B003ZX7RL4','This is basically the best phone I ever owned. Why? Because it has functions that I dreamed about having in my phone. I am not a multiple gadget guy, so I like having just one with everything. Nokia N8 does just that. It has a fantastic camera which rivals of even exceeds that of a regular point-and-shoot, powerful music player which delivers fantastic sound, all kinds of connectivity options: Wi-Fi, 3G, Bluetooth.......and most importantly the call quality. Its just better. Then again it has its drawbacks, like its hard to find stuff in the menus, but thats probably because I have this phone for about 6 hours. About the app store...Why do people complain about it? It has tons of apps that are functional, there are a lot that I would use everyday, not like the IPhone or Android (I had both). Those app store are full of junk, and not a lot of usefull apps. So thats about it. If you are willing to cope with not the best UI, and would like to see lots of features and have great call quality, then this is the phone for you.'),(170,'B003ZX7RL4','After 4 years with the same old 6210 its nice to have a new phone.  Some of the features are really good but the voice activated dialling is rubbish and I have British accent but it cant even handle simple british names.  Nokia should give the option for recording your own voice, as in older models.  The maps free license is the main reason I bought it as I travel a lot and the free maps etc is very useful.  Its very slippery and needs a cover or a strap otherwise I\'d constantly drop it.  I like the 3 separate home screens, useful for personal, business etc.  Its taking me time to get used to a touch screen and I still miss hard buttons to press.  I\'m much slower at texting on this phone and make a lot more errors, even with the full qwerty keyboard in landscape mode!  I have played around with the email facility which was easy enough to set up but its also not something I\'d use.  The internet is very easy to use and useful sometimes for me.  I\'d recommend it, especially if you are already used to touch screen phones.  I still keep accidentally catching the \'end call\'  when an incomming call comes in.  Its right in the area you\'d naturally hold when you get the phone out of your bag or pocket.'),(171,'B003ZX7RL4','One of the best Nokia phones for real.My Experiences with the N8Camera - The camera is amazing! I\'ve taken close to 2000 pictures with this phone and a almost everytime i show someone a pic they think it\'s an image i downloaded over the internet.Build - This is a really sturdy phone, mine has survived countless falls and still works fine.Multimedia Features - I never used the included HDMI cable, but since Nokia made \"Play To\" getting media on my TV is super easy. I still use a cable to play games on the big screen though.Gaming - Most other platforms have more games than symbian, but it\'s not a desert here, there are good games and the phone\'s hardware handles them well.Browsing - Stock browser even in Symbian Belle is not up to par. I use opera mobile which works well.Keyboard - I use the landscape keyboard with auto correct turned on, it\'s off by default...kinda silly from nokia. In portrait mode the T9 works well.Loudspeaker - Good Performance here even when on flat surfaces thanks to the camera hump.FM Transmitter - Definitely a unique feature that more manufacturers should incorporate, very easy to use, especially with Symbian Belle which has a transmitter widget.Performance - Generally good, until you open a heavy webpage, or multiple games. Symbian features true multitasking, but because of the phone specs if you have too many things open the phone will slow down.Battery Life - You\'ll get about a day and a half if you stay off WiFi. Wifi seems to be the biggest consumer of power on this phone, next comes games.'),(172,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ve been very impressed with the phone (actually got two of them, one for myself and one for my wife) - no restarts required.  I\'m not someone who needs to have my computer in my pocket and mostly wanted a phone with a very good camera (this phone as the best you can get) and would be easy to use for basic stuff, calling, texting and be able to do other stuff if needed (e-mail and web etc.).  The interface is smooth and responsive, the phone is smaller than I expected and fits very nicely in the hand or pocket (not a giant half tablet like alot of the newer smartphones).  Voice quality is excellent as well (ATT).In this respect and with the relatively low price for a smart phone with the features it has - it was an easy choice.This phone has the best camera of any phone at this point (Oct 2011) nor is a phone expected to surpass it in this respect.  The reason the camera is so good is that the sensor\'s size (not pixel count but actual physical sensor size) is about 50% larger than other phone cameras (grabs more light) and most stand alone point and shoot camera\'s.  Now its in a phone so its not going to replace your DSLR, but it is the best you can get in a phone.  The other nice thing about the phone is that it uses a real Zenon flash (like a normal standalone point and shoot) instead of a LED like on most phones - so the flash is more powerful.The colors are nice to add a bit of personality to your phone - and being an unlocked phone there\'s none of that ridiculous provider branding and glitchy applications you get when you get a phone from the wireless vendor store.Nokia just released an update to the operating system (called Anna) used in the phone for North America.  Another update called Belle will be coming in the future, so the OS will continue to be updated and improved.One note on the Anna update, I had an issue with the Symbian Anna 1/2 part failing to install (phone still worked), but if you get that here\'s what I did to get around the issue.  Find a PC/Mac and download and install the Nokia Ovi Suite ([...] go to support and get the Nokia Suite or Mac version) and use that to backup your phone first (contacts etc.).  Be sure to use the Windows PC Nokia Ovi Suite to back up your phone (cause your data is going to be deleted).  Now reset the phone Go to MENU => SETTINGS => PHONE =>PHONE MANAGEMENT => FACTORY SETTINGS => DELETE DATA AND RESTORE.  This wipes the phone relatively clean.  After restarting, go through the Ovi setup screen etc. that pop up.  Add your WiFi connection back in (I use this to keep from doing big downloads through my wireless provider).  Now do the update through the phone (main lighted button just below the screen and on the front - Applications - SW update) and make sure only the Symbian Anna 1/2 update is selected (meaning you\'ll have to un-select the Anna 2/2 update) and run the update.  After it succeeds, then do the 2/2 update etc. and you\'re good.  Run the Windows Novi Suite to restore your phone data and your done.'),(173,'B003ZX7RL4','This phone is retard and so very not smart phone...How they hell Nokia could not figure out a way to support social networking features in just wifi mode. To update, to add facebook account, to sync contacts in your phonrbook, to upload picture for everything you need a freakin sim in the phone..... that is so retard. Android and windows7 can do that seamlessly without sim card.  You connect you phone to wifi only without sim card and your phone cannot do nothing y because it says your service has expired. They have same weird setup where they push stuff to your OVI account thru sim. Meaning the day they close OVI your phone will be useless POS.Yes I loved the 12megapixel camera and GPS but I was buying it for international travelling where half of the feature I had to use were in wifi only... what the point of good camera when you cannot upload the picture without sim..... not so smart phone and not so smart ppl.... look at your competition facebook and social sites work seemlessly. I have E71 and N8 well e71 there is no way to upload picture except third party and now n8 there is no way to upload in wifi only mode where all other phones do that right out of the box'),(174,'B003ZX7RL4','just bought the phone, looks  better in real life, feels awesome! touch screen is on the spot, camera is amazing! seriously i had no trouble with the phone. havnt charged it 3 days, still got half the battery, with all the music and vedios n stuff. i dont need to say anything, if your reading these reviews because your not sure you want to buy this phone, i suggest it 100%. eventhou i hate nokia, im more blackberry and sonyericc. im in love with the phone, cant stop playing with it. go ahead, click and buy!'),(175,'B003ZX7RL4','I purchased this phone in good faith, knowing that it\'s no longer really produced/supported by Nokia because Symbian is being phased out.  Nevertheless, I\'m addicted to Nokia Maps and their free voice navigation that is provided with lifetime updates for free.  This is my main reason for sticking with Symbian/Nokia -the minimalistic design of the OS suits me since I don\'t need all the glamour of other operating systems.  That said, the N8 has an amazing camera and took really beautiful pictures, while I had it.Unfortunately the phone was returned because of the following reasons:- Before the OS update that I did when I connected the phone via Ovi, everything worked fine -phone calls, SMS/MMS, native applications, GPS, etc.  AFTER the update however, everything went downhill, as the update changed everything to Chinese (next to English, this was the only available language), changed the phone\'s product code, and rendered MAPS and GPS unusable.  I couldn\'t even open Maps, nor install them via Ovi Suite...  How is this possible?- My lack of faith in the origin of the phone led me figure it out before all the aforementioned mayhem began.  I noted everything from the Device Manager such as the OS details, product code, firmware version etc.  Apparently, when the update installed itself, it recognized the original firmware that was preloaded on the phone, which was of Chinese origin, and installed the update atop it.  All this was checked via Nokia\'s own NaviFirm software.  Some effort was required in piecing the firmware information and product codes together, but what I ended up with was a CHINESE FIRMWARE (for an Orange N8 to top things off -mine was silver).  This all finally made sense, why the installed update changed everything around (it even included some native Chinese apps), including the phone\'s entire usability, and subsequently exposed the seller\'s real scheme.  Note that unless you \"flash\" your phone with a new firmware (and risk bricking the phone, and losing your warranty), you won\'t be able to use it due to its original firmware that comes preloaded on the phone.Furthermore, I have to add that the phone came with missing USB-on-the-Go and HDMI cable.  After reporting this to Amazon CS, Amazon was generous enough to offer a partial refund for the missing cables (You have love Amazon\'s customer service!).  Since I have been a longtime fan of Nokia, I still had my E75 and C7 (original) accessory cables lying around, and I compared the standard USB charging/data cable that came with my original phones and compared it with the N8 from My-Wish-List, and I couldn\'t believe my eyes how fake the N8 cable was, despite having NOKIA written on it.  The lettering and assembly seemed of poor quality, glued together, and the imprinted \"Nokia\" log wasn\'t straight nor was it of the same embossed quality.  This was the straw that broke the camel\'s back and didn\'t hesitate for a split second to return the phone (it was already going back for the GPS issue, but this just solidified my position on the matter even more).I promptly filed an RMA and got my refund ASAP - another great Amazon transaction (the product only fulfilled by them, not sourced, so Amazon\'s not to blame, but the actual seller).  I feel Amazon should no longer support My-Wish-List as their products are nothing more than a bunch of knock-offs made or refurbished in China!!!  If you plan on spending $300 on a fake phone or one of unknown origins, you\'ve been warned -you\'re better off looking for something else, especially when spending some much money.  Comment on the review/thread if you have any questions about my experience with the N8 I bought from here.'),(176,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ve been using N8 for a month now (US) on T-mobile. It\'s the best phone I ever had. So far no problems with it. My most annoying issue was with the Skype mobile app under the old Symbian OS. The phone was slow and unresponsive if you leave the app open for two long. I believe the app had memory leak issues and/or other bugs. No problems so far with other apps (and no more issues with Skype under Belle) - works perfect right out of the box.So far my disappointments:- Amazon doesn\'t ship it with a 16 GB micro SD card (as stated on the Nokia USA site).- It doesn\'t support T-Mobile\'s UMA (WiFi calling without using your minutes and having WiFi reception at areas with bad coverage). This was important to me, as my previous Nokia 6301 had UMA and I was with the impression that this one will support it as well. Keep this in mind if you\'re planning to use it on US T-mobile.- No SWIPE keyboard - not a big deal but still ... (Fixed after software update)- No standard QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode. I believe this can be enabled through the settings (haven\'t done it yet), so it\'s not a huge issue for me. (Fixed after software update)- The inbuilt browser is a bit clunky. Opera Mini is much better and has an outstanding keyboard - a must have. (Fixed after software update)So far what I like:- Great call quality for both voice and video calls.- Excellent signal/reception.- 12 MP camera with outstanding picture quality. Carl Zeiss lenses - it doesn\'t get much better than this! The flash is not that good but still get\'s the job done in close distance. Outdoor pics/videos are amazing. Side note: I just got back from Hawaii and took hundreds of pictures and movies. People don\'t believe me that those were taken with a phone. Outstanding quality. You just have to play a bit with the manual settings/scene modes and you get stunning results (if you know what you\'re doing). Does a good job even on auto though! Probably the best phone camera out there at the moment!- Video recording in HD - 30 fps.- Outstanding build quality.- Good battery life. It has power saving mode which gives you quite an extra usage.- HDMI out with 5.1 Dolby digital sound.- FM transmitter - scans the stations fast. No issues with it.- Good GPS which can be used in offline mode. Just download the maps that you need and you\'re good to go. Good voice commands - it warns you if you\'re speeding (unlike my old Garmin). The GPS (with screen on) drains the  battery quite a bit, but you can put the phone in stand by and only listen to the directions. It doesn\'t always pick the best route, but it get\'s you there in the end.- The CPU and Memory are not the best but the OS runs smoothly without hiccups. At least not with tons of apps loaded at the same time.I\'d recommend the N8 to someone who\'s not so impressed with the eye candy OS features (see update below - the interface got a boost with the latest update) and prefers a simple clean design and a phone with outstanding hardware in it.5/5 from me!New Update: Feb 2012:Got the Nokia Belle OS today. It\'s like getting an entirely new and better phone.The interface got better and much more customizable.Improved HD video capture (30 fps).The the top info status bar (with the battery/WiFi/gadgets info) got a boost on the looks and functionality. You can now switch off the WiFi/packet data/blue tooth from there with a single touch. Very nice.I miss some of the old stuff though: I can\'t find the \"Show all open applications\" (found it - press and hold the button) and some apps do not work on the new OS, but I\'m pretty sure the developers will catch up.This is an amazing OS upgrade. Probably a lot more things got improved - haven\'t had the time to check everything yet. There are rumors that in future it will support some windows apps... Outstanding job from Nokia!Old Update: Nov 2011:I installed the new Symbian Anna update today. Some key improvements came with it:QWERTY in portrait mode - finally :)The interface got a boost. The icons are not that square-ish anymore. The general colors changed from blue to black-dark gray theme. It\'ll take me some to get used to the new interface looks but in general - I like it.The browser got completely changed. The old sluggish navigation style is gone. Better menu and browsing experience. Still not as good as Opera Mini, but hey - huge improvement from the old stuff! Kudos!Improved navigation searching. Still hasn\'t completely tested it out, but it seems that the offline search algorithm is now improved.Overall - good job from Nokia. I thought they completely abandoned Symbian, but it looks like they\'re still strongly supporting it. As I heard, all changes are based on community feedback, which is very good!Old Update Aug 2011:GPS - maps searching: It turns out there is a small bug with OVI Maps. The online and offline search algorithms are different. When searching offline in the US, if you put the ZIP code, most of the time the search doesn\'t return results. City, Address, State, Country is the best way to search offline. In online mode, you can go the regular US standard address format - Address, City, State, ZIP. Not a big issue and it\'s good to know there\'s a workaround.WiFi - there is no central place from where to shut down the WiFi entirely. If any app requires online connection, the WiFi turns on automatically. Setting it up to Manual doesn\'t resolve this. Changing the connection priorities, using the battery power saving mode and setting all desktop apps to offline mode helps, but it\'s still not a good/intuitive solution. I\'d like to have three settings for WiFi - Manual/Known WiFi Networks/Off. Hope Nokia pushes this in a future firmware, as a lot of people are complaining.I still love the phone, despite the minor disappointments above!'),(177,'B003ZX7RL4','Hi people,Im Carlos from Dominican Republic. I used to be a fan of Windows Mobile a few years ago and then about 2 years ago turned Android.While must of the companies are developing or focus on great phones with fast processors, bigger and vivid screens, which one will integrate NCF?, fingerprint reader, getting app update twice a month or a lot of customROMS to flash like a maniac looking for the best performance... Me, ...tired of that life style, prepare myself for something new.I had a really bad and annoying experience with a Nokia 5800 :S It looks so FAT, screen sucks and feel so plastic! Besides that, the Symbian it uses fed me up. The menu or process for doing anything is maddening. It ask for everything. Makes me feel stupid.I did a very detailed research of this device before I placed my order. I read every single review on amazon and from other websites. At first, I was REALLY scare of the Sleep Of Dead [SOD] that happens on some units but I assume de risk and hope not to use the \"return\" option.Here are my POSSITIVE impressions of the Nokia N8:+ Penta Band 3G: Wherever I go, USA, Europe, Caribbean I\'ll have 3G access! That\'s cool.+ AMOLED screen: Looks great and it\'s nice to know that it has gorilla scratch resistant. Of course iF4 and must of Android devices has better graphics.+ Housing/Design: Perfect! The aluminium finish, nice material and the silver color makes a great balance.+ Camera/Xenon Flash: Much better than all Windows Mobile, Android that I\'ve used. I cant compare to iphone4 since I haven\'t use it.+ FM Radio wRDS and Transmitter: Nowadays it\'s not common to listen FM stations but I\'ve found the FM Transmitter very useful! The only issue is that must be really close to the radio in order to work better.+ Signal: Great. I\'ve experience this talking volume in Blackberry devices. The sound is adequate.+ Battery: Great so far :D Gives more than a day. With Android devices battery last 6-12hrs...+ USB On the Go: Havent test it but It\'s really cool to know It\'s on your device!+ HDMI: Havent test it but It\'s really cool to know It\'s on your device!NEGATIVE Impressions from other REVIEWS and my fixes:- Virtual Keyboard: Yes, it\'s bad at first. Need some time to get used to it but It\'s good using Spanish language. We\'ll have an update soon, so, we hope Nokia do something with this! There is also another keyboard called \"DAYHAND\" just google it... It seems that is not available any more.- Browser: IT REALLY SUCKS!!! Try Opera and use Opera Link to have your Favorite websites linked.- No OFFICE Documents Edit: Yes, This was fixed with an update... Anyways I don\'t use it.- Video Recording has no light: So? Some other devices don\'t have it either... Im so satisfied with the Xenon that I don\'t really care of LED.- Battery is not User friendly replaceable: So?!?!?! With Symbian there is no need of flash-a-holic and do some crazy app installations. Just press the power button for a few seconds and I\'ll restart.- Poor Application Store: It\'s right, it\'s not the best. But must of the application I use are available. Too bad Developers are not motivated :(- GPS: I can\'t use OVI MAPS in my country. Looking for google maps for Symbian...EXPECTATIONS1) Announcement of the next update with fixes of all software issued including new keyboard!.2) Hope my N8 dont DIE!!! I wouldnt like to start a return-waiting process.Well, That\'s all folks. Sorry for my extended review.Oh! Last thing: Don\'t forget to buy the otterbox to protect this little toy :D'),(178,'B003ZX7RL4','I love this phone. It was love for the first sight. :) I like the color (green), it is very well made and the size is just perfect. The camera is amazing! The gps works without data plan. Sometimes it needs a little time to start navigation, but it works well. I used it in Europe, I didn\'t have any problem. I just changed the sim card what I bought there, I downloaded the map and used it. The battery life is very good too. Using the camera it doesn\'t bother the battery, but when I use the navigation or chatting on skype I have to charge end of the day.'),(179,'B003ZX7RL4','First of all, I wanted to say that I\'ve been a loyal Nokia user for many years and have bought so many different Nokia phones that I\'ve lost count and I\'ve always like every single one of them. However, it seems like they\'re falling behind, especially for the US market at least. That\'s why I started looking at other phones that suits my needs and then started using various phones with android OS.Ever since I saw this the N8 announced I was excited and looked forward to getting one. When it finally went on sale I bought a black one last year to replace my android phone (had a htc legend at the time).First impression was I absolutely loved this phone\'s feel and look and how simple everything was. Then after a couple of weeks, I got bored of this phone and its lack of usable apps.Things I liked about this phone- Feels and looks great, very solid phone- Has all the bands/frequencies to be used world wide- Awesome camera for a phone- Xenon flash, even tho I don\'t use it lol- Simple to use- Great battery life- Very nice screen and I like that pulsing light thing on the buttonThings I didn\'t like about this phone- Whenever I\'m talking on the phone, sometimes the screen doesn\'t turn off and I guess somehow my cheeks touched the end button and disconnects the call. Happens quite often and was very annoying.- Picture taken from this camera looks great but once I upload it from phone to facebook, the quality was pretty crappy- Don\'t have Pandora- Lack of good apps- I won\'t always get my emails, will need to restart phone then start receiving emails again- Phone lags sometimes when going through menu or using one of their useless appsAnother thing I hated was that I spent $2.99 to buy the angry bird game and it didn\'t even have as many levels as the ones for android, which was FREE! That was quite disappointing. Not phone\'s fault, just symbian I guess.Ended up selling this phone and went back to android, got the galaxy s, which by the way has been one of the best phones I\'ve ever used so far. Thought I give Nokia a try again but symbian just seems so behind. I\'m not saying the N8 is a bad phone, it\'s just not for me. If this phone has android OS, it would be my perfect phone! This is kind of a short review, since I bought it and sold it over 9 or 10 months ago.'),(180,'B003ZX7RL4','Plenty of reviews have been written and I don\'t want to go into technical details here. I love the phone. It is a perfect replacement for my aging N82. It\'s my first touchscreen phone and it took me only a few days to get used to it (I never read manuals). I probably only use half of its features and do not download plenty of apps. Therefore I am not a good judge. One fun feature is you can remote control the phone with your Wii remote and watch HD pictures on your TV through HDMI output, amazing! But what I was looking for in a phone is a built-in GPS, a nice camera, good call quality, decent battery life and large memory. The N8 has all of that. The only thing I am missing is the lens cover my N82 had. Sometimes I take a picture and then notice some blur on the picture due to dirt on the lens. One thing I didn\'t like, Nokia went through 2 operating system changes within 1 year. Each time most of my apps were gone and I had to re-install everything, kind of annoying. I guess this is Nokia\'s last stand against the smart phone market they slumbered away. I will miss you Nokia.'),(181,'B003ZX7RL4','I was hoping for this phone to be as amazing as it seemed; however, I have been entirely unsuccessful in determining whether it is or not.The model I received on 5/30/12 was D.O.A - from what I\'ve read, the battery has the possibility of refusing a charge once it dips below a certain point. Hoping that I simply had acquired a faulty unit, I promptly exchanged the phone for a new one from Amazon.Unfortunately, the same problem persists in the second handset as well; the charging indicator light won\'t even respond. Needless to say, I am quite disappointed.The production date for both handsets is February of 2011 - perhaps newer batches do not suffer from the same issue. Nevertheless, I am now somewhat disillusioned by this product, and will be requesting a refund shortly.'),(182,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ve bought this Nokia N8 because it has thousands of features like GPS, Radio Transmitter, 12 mp Camera, nokia Maps Navigator, MP3 player, V&iacute;deo Player (every file types), and the colour, which I choose!Unfortunately, my belong N8 came death from the box. I sent to Nokia twice. The first time they didn\'t fixed it at all. The second they figured out  the smartphone had an issue. They couldn\'t fixed and replaced for another N8, but they didn\'t have the colour I have choose!!! After lots of calls and lots of months without my new N8, they finally sent another N8 but colour black!It worked, but it wasn\'t new and it wasn\'t green!I really lost my faith on Nokia and since then I never bought any Nokia product again and never indicated it to anyone.Cheers!!!'),(183,'B003ZX7RL4','This phone is great is you want as much capability as possible crammed into a hand-held device. No, it doesn\'t have the most simple or flashy user interface, and if you only browse the web and download games, better stick with something simpler. But if you want some power-user features, this fits the bill nicely.The camera is most impressive. I recently compared it to my Panasonic TS1 camera, which isn\'t shabby itself, and the N8 got better-looking photos, with better sharpness, contrast and color accuracy, not to mention vastly more detail in low light and no annoying chroma noise. Also love the bright wide-angle lens, and the Xenon flash. I only wish it had better dynamic range in the highlights. Make no mistake - it leaves any other phone camera in the dust.The OS is packed with features like a file browser, Bluetooth file transfers, photo editor, HD video recording, turn-by-turn navigation, mass storage \"drag and drop\" support, and more. The interface is intuitive and easy enough to use. I know a lot of people complain how it\'s not as \"slick\" and \"polished\" compared to Apple\'s, but I personally find Apple\'s interface disgustingly limiting and restrictive, thus I prefer a more capable OS.I also love the multi-tasking abilities. I can follow turn-by-turn navigation while listening to music while taking photos at the same time with this phone, and it performs without a hiccup.The multi-media capabilities are quite nice too. With 16GB internal storage and powerful hardware, I can simply copy movies from my computer to the phone, and it plays them back flawlessly. The music player has an easy to use interface and the sound quality is excellent. It also comes with a good-sounding headset, which can control the player.It has 3G on every band, which means I can have a fast connection with any GSM carrier.The keyboard is ok, but I still prefer a hardware keyboard.While it offers plenty of features, it\'s missing some abilities compared to my older Nokia E71. It can\'t create a custom EQ preset, can\'t edit ID3 tags, can\'t edit office documents without a paid upgrade (Edit - as of January 2011, a firmware update enabled office document editing), and can\'t encrypt the memory (Edit - the upgrade to Symbian Belle enabled memory encryption). At least it has a passcode lock, and while locked, you can\'t access the phone via the USB port, so that should stop all but the most determined hackers and crackers.Overall, I am quite pleased with the phone. On paper, it may not have the most impressive specs, but in actual use I found it to be a surprisingly capable and powerful device.'),(184,'B003ZX7RL4','Glad I didn\'t listen to the recent negative reviews. I\'m not sure whats going on there, but this phone rocks. This was in my cart for months and I finally bought due to price drop and tax refund. This is my first touchscreen phone and after a week its so unbelievable. You can download apps from the ovi store. That is an app that is already on the homepage of the phone it takes you to where you buy more. The phone is so customizable. I have bought the charger and otterbox commuter, but the phone is so well made and the plastic screen cover that is on is still on and seems to be just as good so I will leave it on. Looks like they are getting newer games that are on the iphone and android too. Just yesterday \"Cut the Rope\" came out. The graphics on this phone are unbelievable. Lots of power to take advantage of. The gps map is available offline, which is awesome because I have t-mobile prepaid plan and I put my sim card in there and just use my home wifi or any wifi that has open access to get on the web, so that is a huge money savings. So I would get this phone and spend some time checking it out. The first 2 days were scary I was so clueless but you can search for N8 help on the web and lots of forums out there and then it because intuitive and you start knowing how to do things. Especially typing at first I was so slow and I have big hands but now as I play/practice I am getting much faster:-) All in all a great deal!'),(185,'B003ZX7RL4','This phone is harder to use than the iPhone.  It is so hard to go back to the previous screen without having to start over again. I do not like the fact that the phone went down in value so fast. When Amazon ship me the phone I receive the phone for three days and check the price of the phone and it went down by a hundred dollars. When I call customer service to see if I could get a credit for the difference and they refuse to do so. I am really diappointed.  Overall the phone is really hard to function  I like the iPhone better'),(186,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ve used Nokia for a while. I\'ve stuck with Nokia because their call quality is the clearest and the battery life is always the best and nearly unchanging after 3+ years. I\'ve had three phones, all nokia, since 2001 and I\'ve always been satisfied, they break due to freak accidents.The N8-00 was nice, especially with Belle installed. Camera was perfect, good amount of functional apps. Great GPS. Great storage. A little laggy at times, but it\'s seriously for maybe 2 or 3 seconds and it happened once.The downside is ... I purchased this phone a couple weeks after Easter, and it\'s already dead. I paid almost 500.00$ for the phone on here. Was walking back from a volunteer thing and it started raining a little, put it in my zipped jacket pocket, took it out, it was dead. Barely had any moisture near it and it died. I tried flushing it with de-mineralized water like they told me to on nokia\'s twitter account, now it won\'t even turn on.Noticed that they split the price down by a little over 100.00$ now and it sucks that there\'s nothing that can be done about my phone :(. Too poor to get another phone now. Aside from how ridiculously weak the n8 is with water, I loved the phone, wish I had another one.'),(187,'B003ZX7RL4','experience with the n8 was successful. what I did not like when I got the phone was not working, and I had to take it to service where I was told that the battery came damaged. was why I bother with amazon that sold me a phone with a damaged battery. the phone has new battery and works great. new battery for the phone in my country cost me $ 58.14 and Venezuela is not just because the phone was to bring ua new battery in good condition. so I recommend you pueben the goods to ensure its proper functioning and amazon buyers we will not be harmed as happened to me, that I should pay more money to operate the phone they buy'),(188,'B003ZX7RL4','I just replaced my old Nokia E71 for this new Nokia N8.  At first glance this phone has many improvements and I would say it is a little bit more user friendly.I wish this phone had a portrait or vertical querty keyboard; it only works if the phone is placed horizontally.  This could be a nice software update from Nokia.  The phone doesn\'t vibrate that hard either, I have lost some calls because I didn\'t feel it vibrating.I also had to download another webpage browser named Opera which is a lot faster than the original one of the phone.'),(189,'B003ZX7RL4','Well, i was worried like anyone when i bought this cellphone (i bought it from amazon 2 weeks ago) because of the hardware problems like the purple amoled... or the dead camera or the dead nokia... Ive been using it for 2 weeks now and i just can say that this nokia is PERFECT. No problems at all... Since i bought it it has restarted just 1 time... The camera is perfect. Now i can take those special moments with my friends and my family with the quality of a high end camera!!! The apps are ok for me. I got skype, facebook chat and angry birds :D. Is a perfect multimedia phone. The messaging is ok... Landscape keyboard is not good for my fat fingers :S. Multitouching is perfect. Perfect respone when looking at photos. The web explorer is... well... crap... I recommed downloading Opera. But as far as ive been using it the phone is perfect without problems. I recommed it for symbian lovers :)'),(190,'B003ZX7RL4','I will begin by saying that I have been a Nokia fan for several years mainly for the type of designs, materials and built quality of the brand phones. My latest device was the E71 (Unlocked version made in Finland) which I consider to be the best phone that the company has produced. Symbian operating system structure has never been an issue for me since I rather like a stable OS that has been proven efficient for several years now.I am a Mechanical Engineer which has held several positions requiring a very good attention to details, deep troubleshooting thinking process and analysis and evaluation of different types of equipment failures. Currently I held a position in the Nuclear Industry.So far I have gone through three (3) Nokia N8 in less than a month with all the units shown significant signs that this device is not being put together well. I will say that the Nokia N8, in my personal opinion, is a well design device that separates itself from the rest of mass produced devices currently in the market. The phone specs are very impressive and the materials guarantee a long durability. However all this looks wonderful on paper but what is coming out from the production line is far, far from what was conceived in the design table. This phone particular design, in my personal opinion, requires a very well controlled manufacturing process to maintain the quality of the finished device. This strict quality control appears to be missing at least on the units I have bought.All the phones I am referenced in here were bought at AMAZON.COM as brand new units and I received them with the Nokia seal intact on the shipped boxes. All the units I have received are MADE IN CHINA which I will not rush to conclude it is the main contributor to the phone issues but it probably is.The first unit was my first disappointment right out of the box. This device came with the unlock sliding key significantly loose and the rattling was very annoying (something that I might have live with it for a $100.00 phone but not for what is expected to be a high end product priced at over $500.00) . I also noted visible miss-alignments on both end caps in relation to the main cover body. So I returned this unit without further use of it.The second unit kept showing what appears to be a trend on this product. I found two (2) visible marks on both sides of the phone cases next to the ring that appears to secure the phone screen (it appears that excessive effort had to be made to finalize the assembly of the screen on this particular unit). Also, the camera lens and the xenon flash are not centered (it appears that the finish Aluminum plate that is glued on top of the camera, flash and speakers area was not placed with care). Here again noted a visible miss-alignments on both end caps in relation to the main cover body. I still have this unit on hand but probably will return it.The Third unit (which I felt so lucky I got it for $429.00 on Cyber Monday eve) was again another big disappointment. This one appears to be the worst one so far. The front camera appears to be missing its end cover which I can see on the other unit I still have at home. Here again noted a visible miss-alignments on both end caps in relation to the main cover body with the top one significantly off-set showing a visible gap where the earpiece is located. The main camera has failed to close the lens twice while exiting from the camera main screen.As you can see most of the issues I have mentioned here are related to the manufacturing process of this device. As you might know already Nokia itself has admitted that the most talked issue that this phone is experiencing (the power down of the device without any previous action) is been tracked down to the manufacturing lines. So if so far this what we can see on the outside of the phone, What about the internal assembly of this device? How reliable these units can be? Again, this is considered a high end device designed to compete with the high ranked smart phones currently leading the market.As far as the reported performance of the new OS, all three phones have shown sudden slowdowns, sluggishness and a lot of inconsistencies. Maybe clocking up an all processor instead of using a new one was not the best choice made.To conclude I will say that the Nokia N8 is a marvelous device, in paper, worth the $549.00 retail price. The Nokia N8 coming out of the production lines is worth much, much, much less or maybe no worth at all for now. You might still buy this phone but just be aware what you are getting into.'),(191,'B003ZX7RL4','Okay so this was initially a 1 star review for no fault of Amazon.com but Nokia because the N8 i bought through Amazon was bad, it rebooted, froze etc. I got in touch with Amazon and they sent me a new one on overnight shipping. Many thank to Amazon.com for prompt service and great customer care. This unit now works great so far, its 3 days now, i have it going into the 4th day, got it on June 14, 2012. The Symbian belle update will cause the phone to not play flash content such as videos that are on your favorite websites like youtube.com(desktop version) so if watching flash videos are your thing then right now this not gonna do that for you. i have no complaints as it relates to the hardware of the device, it feels really solid. the Belle update works good too minus the inability to load flash content, funny enough you will see ad banners work, but if you wanted to stream a embedded video its a no go for that, its been 6-7 months since the release of the Belle update and still Nokia has not corrected the adobe flash problem so im not sure what happening there. I do wish that Nokia gave it more memory on the C: drive. The tiny 256Mb is a joke when the mass memory has some 14Gb of storage...lol, i wonder what is the reasoning behind that???? oh the front camera not that great either. it does take picture but it would seem like a 0.3 or 1 mega-pixel, a 1.3 mega-pxl would have compliment the rear 12mp. Well like i said its a good phone, but Nokia has yet to fix the issue of playing embedded flash content and the C: drive or phone memory is too low (256Mb), im a keep mine for now and see if Nokia gonna fix the Flash issue.-UPDATESo in regards to the flash player, im not sure if there will be an update for the Belle that will allow us to watch flash content embedded on websites or stream from youtube desktop site as the current flash lite 4 does not support those contents. if you get the phone stick to Anna DO NOT update, or you wont be able to play flash.'),(192,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this phone from Amazon two weeks ago and I\'ve been playing around with it since. In my opinion, this is the BEST Nokia phone to date. Now, before reading any further, I\'ll give some background information about me so whoever is reading this can possibly relate and continue reading OR not relate and move onto another review:- I\'m a male, age 25-30.- Consider myself pretty technologically savvy (career is in IT).- Previous phones: Motorola Razr, then Nokia N95 8GB, and now Nokia N8.- Originally purchased an iPhone 4 16GB, but didn\'t like the feel of the phone in my hand (Nokia N8 has a better feel), and was not fond of the simplicity of the iPhone 4.- I like being somewhat different and not having a phone that the majority have (although if everybody started buying an N8 now, I wouldn\'t sell mine and get another kind).- Live in Canada (had a friend bring this over for me) and use this with Rogers Wireless and it works great!So here\'s a breakdown of what I like and don\'t like about the Nokia N8.What I LIKE about the:Camera- 12 megapixel camera takes great quality pictures! You can do normal view and also take widescreen shots.- There\'s a Nokia Panaroma app that stitches together pictures for you! Great for taking landscape pictures!- HD recording is amazing--the video and sound recorded is surprising.- There\'s a built-in lens cover that automatically opens up and closes unlike my N95.- Built-in image editing (i.e. no need for a Fat Booth app--you can edit yourself and edit even more things!)- Looking at pictures and watching video is great on the screen.Call Quality- Crystal clear. Didn\'t have a problem with N95, and same goes for Nokia N8Keyboard/Texting- Despite other people complaining about a lack of a qwerty keyboard in portrait mode, I actually prefer the numeric keypad using T9. The buttons are bigger, so it\'s easier for one-handed texting.Homescreen- 3 customizable homescreens. I use 2 though--one for apps, and one to see a list of my e-mails from Gmail and Hotmail, my notes/reminders, and the music player.Music Player- Very easy to use, FM transmitter works great.Syncing Contacts/Calendar- I was able to sync my google contacts and calendar using Mail for Exchange.Gorilla Glass Screen- My girlfriend prematurely took off the screen protector that came with the phone, and I freaked out thinking it would get imperfected before I got a chance to put on a different screen protector. Now, I\'m actually considering not putting anything on it at all. There has been no scratches--anything and everything that has gotten on it was able to get wiped off.Maps/GPS- Free maps and navigation for life! GPS finds my location very quickly.- Ovi Maps is great and is constantly improving. They teamed up with TripAdvisor to give you a feature that will provide information on restaurants, shopping, sights, etc based on your location on the GPS---so you can read reviews of things that are close to you!Battery- I charged it fully before using and then discharged it fully for the second usage.- Takes about 2 hours on an empty battery to a full charge.- I was able to get 2 full days of moderately heavy usage on the phone before the battery ran out.- Now I try to keep the battery charged up as much as possible to maintain its life.What I DISLIKE about the:Call Quality- The other person on the other line sometimes reports hearing their own voice speaking, but I can\'t conclude whether this is the fault of the phone, or the wireless service, because it has happened just a few times.Vibration- Okay, well this isn\'t really a problem anymore, but I know other users have complained that when the phone is on silent/pager mode, the vibration when getting a text message is to quick and weak. Well that\'s because the default \"Ringing Type\" setting is set of OFF. You need to set it to \"BEEP ONCE\" and you\'ll get a nice long vibration alerting you of your incoming text messages.Music- There\'s not button on the sides to go control your music (I\'m used to having accessible buttons like the N95), but it\'s not that big of an issue for me.Maps/GPS- There is no overview of all the turns/roads you need to take to reach your destination, which I\'m sure (hopefully) they will add in a future update.Apps- Lots of people complain about the lack of apps, and so do I. But this phone is still new, and I\'m looking forward to more and more development of different apps for it.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. I got what I wanted in a phone with lots of customization, great camera, and great build quality to last for some time. I hope my review has helped you out.'),(193,'B003ZX7RL4','I just recieved a Orange N8 (3/31/2011) that was victim to the AMOLED \"Purple\" screen issue, this may mean there is a bad batch in the Amazon warehouse. Google \"N8 Screen Problem\" to learn more. But just be cautious.  On a lighter note, this was to be my second N8, it may not be the pretiest UI but is definatley does the most of any smart phone I have owned, and i have had my fare share (2.2 Froyo, iOS4, S60, S40) If you are looking for a dependable \"Do anything\" device this is it, If you are loking for constant fun, look elseware. If it is photo and video that you love, look no further and hit the \"add to cart\" button.'),(194,'B003ZX7RL4','Four stars only because the phone is now dated. No four G holds it back and sadly Nokia will drop  Symbian in the near future. That being said I love this phone it does everything I need it to do quite well.  Battery life is very good, reception is above average and and it\'s rugged.  It\'s been dropped onto concrete from six foot up a few times and could care less.  Screen is small by the standard of today\'s phones but find it readable in bright sunlight. Very very nice camera.  Has never crashed in the year I\'ve had it. No Google  or apple tracking your every move.  and wanting to keep you on the  &#34;farm&#34;  But some specific apps  for say your bank and such are just not available and won\'t be.  And download a different browser Nokia\'s is a tad slow.  Anyhow bottom line is I\'m  keeping this thing until it just won\'t work any more I like it that much!  Unfortunately I will leave Nokia after this phone as do not wish to be forced to a windows phone and not going to android or ios  either.  Pity.  Nokia makes great hardware.  If you can live with some limitations this is a great phone.'),(195,'B003ZX7RL4','For this amazing price, the HTC Desire was the android comparison I looked at before I purchased the N8. So much bashing has taken place concerning Nokia\'s symbian - but mainly from \"review sites\". Actual owners hardly have anything negative to say. Having used both, I cant say which one is \"better\" as there are pros and cons to each, and each person has their own preference. Like other decisions, this one involves trade offs that the buyer must make. I chose the N8 because: Solid construction, gorilla glass, 12MP camera, HD video, FM transmitter, HDMI & TV out, 16GB storage, bluetooth 3.0, Nokia legendary reliability and the battery last days (not hours). If you are willing to forgo all these for the android experience, that\'s personal preference. In my opinion a pretty UI is not everything and Symbian ^3 is fast and responsive! Bottom line is the N8 is value for money (the camera alone is worth the price!). Just one more point for those who may have an \"issue\" with their phone - TRY UPDATING THE FIRMWARE!'),(196,'B003ZX7RL4','As a previous owner of other rival phones (e.g.- iPhone, Android, Blackberry), I am extremely satisfied with the overall performance of Nokia\'s new arrival, the N8.  After a week of use, I find myself being continuously impressed and rarely disappointed.  Its most stand-out feature, of course, being the beefy 12 MP Carl Zeiss camera. The capabilities and features embodied in this addition rival most stand-alone digital cameras.  The editing tools and other options, via apps and widgets pertaining to the camera, just add to the already impressive capabilities of the hardware.Also, the Cymbian^3 OS is an improvement from previous Nokia OSs and it is way ahead of its competitors in terms of stability and overall function. Most surprising is the ease at which the phone can be navigated and settings can be modified.  Like with most open-source phones, every ounce of memory and seemingly limitless control is at the user\'s fingertips.  The interface is very easy-to-use and Nokia provides many useful tips in the form of notifications, which can be disabled if necessary, to inform the user about some capabilities that may be passing them by.Going back to hardware, the phone has a number of convenient attributes. The scratch-resistant, and nearly damage-proof, gorilla glass screen is something all phones should consider using in the future.  This is one of the few phones that manages to combine durability and responsiveness, without making any sacrifices.  The HDMI and mini-USB jacks are a wonderful addition as well when you consider the opportunities they provide.I could continue to praise every little thing about this phone, but I should conclude with a few notable shortcomings. Most apparent, especially for those who previously owned an iPhone or Android phone, would be the severe lack of apps on the Ovi store. Those users interested in frivolous, time-wasting apps will not be satisfied with the currently destitute app store. Although many of the apps and widgets available are not geared toward fun as much as function, previous users of those app-rich phones might feel lost in the world of Nokia. Another downfall is the standard web browser for the N8. Its clunky, non-responsive operations seem out of place in the phone\'s otherwise efficient OS.  Fortunately, Nokia is aware of this issue and it is something that can easily be improved via a simple update.  Finally, like many phones of its kind, battery life may prove to be a hindrance.  It is difficult to say that the battery life of the N8 is any worse than any of its competitors and users can easily figure out ways of improving battery life. I only note this because I have been led to believe, by several reviews, that this phone boasted an extremely long battery life, while what I am experiencing is average at best.In closing, I can honestly say that this is the best phone that I have ever used in terms of overall capability, reliability, and durability. Those of you looking for the next big thing, deciding between the iPhone or Android, or even just looking to try something new, I implore you to give the Nokia N8 a shot.  You won\'t be disappointed.'),(197,'B003ZX7RL4','i love the phone overall.  great camera, very fast connecting GPS (as compared to the Nokia 5800 and other nokia phones)  great internet.  very cool apps, most are free.the cons:the operating system is VERY UNSTABLE.  it crashes/freezes very often. even in the menus, it will freeze, or refuse to open new apps.  it also hangs while opening some apps, or the touch screen buttons stop working.  for the life of me, i can not transfer the music onto this phone.  it should be as simple as finding the music on the memory card (that was in my nokia 5800)  but it can not find that music.  last night, i put the music onto the phone  directly, and after scanning for 8 hours, it found 10 sounds.the battery life is horrible.  the phone is trying to do to much, and it drains the battery.  for example, it is constantly trying to connect to the internet (or scans for it),  it is constantly turning on the GPS feature to tell you your location, and current temp in the city (or area of the city) you are in.i would say the battery life is about 6 hours, even on power saving mode, it is only about 2 days.games are unstable, they often freeze.the speakers that are built inside the phone sound horrible.  compare the sound quality to the Nokia 5800, and these speakers sound like headphone speakers that are turned up way to loud.  the 5800 had more then 1 speaker, and sounded great.also, please note that this is just not my phone.  many people are complaining about this on Nokia\'s official forums, and we are waiting for a more stable update to come out to fix the operating system.  all phones with this operating systems are reporting similar problems (c6, n8, and e7, 97)once they fix that, it will be the best phone on the market.  when it works well, it is a great phone, but i am upset i paid so much for an unstable phone.'),(198,'B003ZX7RL4','Hello this review has been updated and lowered in rating.  We have 2 N8s and both of them froze and died.  This is a problem for many people and I would not recommend this phone until Nokia fixes this issue.Here are my pros and cons about this phone.  I have owned a lot of top smartphones, so I figured I would highlight what I find excels and what lags current crop.  Overall it is a very good phone.Pros:Camera - The camera is pretty much perfect.  You can tell they put a lot of time into it because the software works well and the pictures are great.  There simply is no better camera out there on a phone.Construction - This is a very attractive, and study phone.  I have no doubt it will last a long time, it is very nicely engineeredBattery Life - Battery lasts longer than any other smartphone I have used.Memory-  People criticise the lack of ram, but I have not run out of ram ever, and actually having more ram wastes battery.Radios - Pentaband phone, not very common.  This will work everywhere on earth pretty much.Navigation - Free, no data connection needed and works very well.  GPS works better than any other phone I have used. Syncs fast and works even without view of sky.Sports Tracker - It is awesome!OMAP processor - Do not listen to MHZ junkies, this processor is very nice because it handlesConnectivity - This phone is the first one I have ever had that switches between Wifi, 3G etc seemlessly and shuts off data when phone not in use.  Very well done.HDMI out/video - works well and default player plays nearly any format you throw at it.  even MKV files.ConsWeb Browser - After using the maemo browser on n900 I realize how good mobile browsing should be.  The default browser sucks bad.  I know they are coming out with update, but that is no excuse, should ship with good browserOn screen keyboard - It is terrible, Opera mini did it right on N8 why can nokia not do it.Screen - The resolution is relatively low for modern smart phones.  It looks very nice, but when you view pages zoomed out text is garbled due to lack of resolution.  I have pretty good vision so I like to read tiny text rather than zoom in.UI - Symbian is a perfectly fine OS, but the UI is inconsistent.  Some areas you hit enter to have setting go, some you have to hit check then ok, some menus go away when you touch shaded part etc.  Nothing is consistent.'),(199,'B003ZX7RL4','I had problems with this phone in the beginning. The first phone was delivered dead on arrival and I returned it. I got soon a replacement phone which worked fine for one day and it started to have problems too; it died first after one day of use for 15 minutes, then it worked well for a while and died for one day; I could not turn the power on or off or do anything. I just had to wait until it randomly started to work again. The third replacement unit works well.I believe my review tells quite much same stories than everybody else; the 12 megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss lenz and free GPS navigation are excellent! This is the reason why I pretty much chose my mobile; I like to carry good quality camera always with me. Free GPS is a very handy too as I am new in the country.The Symbian operating system feels slow and old fashioned compared to it\'s competitors iOS and Android. Also there\'s not so much applications available to N8 than to Symbian 3. However I haven\'t find this as a problem because I rarely play games etc. with my mobile phone. I prefer to use my computer for such activities.Web browsing is also slow and not so user friendly than e.g. in IPhone. I also had a problems with Nokia Ovi - Microsoft Outlook calendar sync; but I found a workaround; you have to install old version of PC Suite to get it working.In overall I am quite happy with this product. If you want the best mobile phone camera and free GPS navigation I think this is a very good choice for a mobile phone. If you use your mobile phone mainly for web surfing and playing games and using tons of different application, then some other phone might be better choice for you.'),(200,'B003ZX7RL4','This is by far the best smartphone on the market. I have tried Samsung, Motorola, Sony, iPhone, LG and Nokia phones in the past. And this is the best one yet.  The N8 exceeds the expectation.Pros:- Outstanding 12 megapixel HD camera with Xenon flash. This camera has been compared even to DSLR\'s on the market.- GPS that connects quickly and works even in Offline mode unlike other phones which require data connection.- You can connect USB drives to it...I like this feature, u can take photos and give to family/friends in their USB then and there.- Awesome games in Nokia OVI appstore- Nokia has the best call quality- FM radio- Can use Opera browser...which I use every day.- Can add several email addresses to sync in real-time- Very sturdy case and screen- On-board photo and video editingCons:- Can\'t get it on AT&T; plan so you have to pay full priceIf you want a phone with the best camera, gps, call quality, network reception, HD with dolby surround sound, Panorama picture taking, and much more, you can\'t go wrong with the Nokia N8.'),(201,'B003ZX7RL4','I totally agree with other reviews about all good things of N8, such as fast boot, great camera, good signal,...I will not repeat here.I have two main problems with N8:1. UI not friendlyYes it\'s fancy, but all those simply functions should be kept as simple as possible. for example, I want to save a number from incoming call list, when I touch that number, it dials the number automatically. I know I can figure it out after searching/reading something (BTW, no paper manual with the package, you either use \"user guide\" on the phone, or googl search; using \"user guide\" is painfull too), but why should I spend time on making these basic features work? Hi man, is it a SMART phone to test how smart you are??2. the biggest problem for me: no multiple language supportI bought it at AMAZON, US version. If you speak English only, please forgive me, it\'s not a problem for you. you can ignore here now. But if you plan to use N8 to read SMS or browse webpage or input something in other languages, such as Hebrew, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Japanese, Spanish, French... Read this\"Nokia has decided that each phone sold to each region (Europe, China, North America, Middle East Africa, India, Thailand) would have separate language packs. If you live in North America, you probably get Latin Fonts without support for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew.... etc. and the Keyboard is limited to English, French, Spanish, maybe Italian...\"After searching google several hours, I found a not perfect way to hack N8 and change language package. But again, why should I do this with a risk to break the warranty?? I am an end user, not a developer. When my iphone/Android phones are able to browse web pages, read text messages in these languages..., where is Nokia?? Maybe Nokia doesn\'t need to compete with iphone/Android phone.\"Connecting the World\"?? Come on, I can\'t!!! In the end, I return the phone.'),(202,'B003ZX7RL4','Longtime Nokia user and this phone does impress with all the hardware it has. Only gripe i have is that when is the symbian anna or belle update going to be available for USA? Also it froze one time when i was using the GPS, and the WIFI keeps turning on even if you disconnect it, anyone know how to fix this? I have tried everything I had to delete the access point for it to stop turning on, or putting the phone on offline mode but then on offline you cannot receive or make calls or receive text messages. Overall though it is a great phone with a few flaws I have listed above, if the next updates can get this fixed 5 out of 5 stars for me.'),(203,'B003ZX7RL4','First I\'ll mention the negatives:- The web browser is not good.  This may get fixed, but no matter what it will be limited by the processor.  Using Opera Mobile for casual browsing is fine, but you will not get flash.- The UI is a bit clunky.  Some people really go off on things like \"it\'s hard to access wifi\" without knowing how to use the device.  (pro tip, click on the very top right of the screen, then click on \'wifi networks found\'... it\'s that easy).These problems will be improved, but will probably always be an issue.  If you can deal with it, here is what you can do (and I did) on a trip to Brazil:- I had far better maps than the iPhone crowd and did not break the bank having to download all those maps over the air.- I took very nice 12MP photos (the major reason for this device)- I accessed my exchange email and my gmail just fine with the built-in application.- I played angry birds a lot- I loaded up a 16GB card with around 25 divx backup movies and watched them: on the plane, on an HDTV with the included HDMI cable, and on an older tv in my hotel with a VGA cable from a previous Nokia phone (it plugs into the head phone jack).I\'m having to return this phone as it seems to suffer from a power problem that others have experienced.  It reboots regularly when cold, and occasionally at other times.  I\'ll be getting another of a different color.'),(204,'B003ZX7RL4','I got this phone for my wife last year, mainly because of the 12mp camera, and it has worked very well for her. She uses it mainly for phone and camera, very little else, she\'s happy.I bought a new one for myself 12/2012 and can only say I was having so many problems with it right out of the box that I ended up sending it back. One problem was the camera would freeze up if I took a picture with the sd card in. Another problem was the phone would not hold a charge for more than a day. I tried all sorts of reloads and fixes from the Nokia site, didn\'t fix it. Shouldn\'t have to do that with a new phone anyway, so I returned it.

Just received it yesterday and tried to use it the last couple hours, it turned out to be a total dissatisfaction.1.Nokia Ovi store is in short of apps, even more, lots of them charge you 2.99+.2.Language packs made available on a Nokia phone is market and region dependent. For me, I would like to have Chinese and Japanese support, which is impossible unless I bought this phone from countries where the language is mainly spoken.3.Can not make Skype video call, the front camera is only for display.4.Default web browser takes about 15 to 30 secs to open up a webpage. Slow,sluggish,worst than I expected. Got better switching to Opera.Will spend this long weekend to dig into it more, but very likely will have to return it due it the poor user experience provided.'),(207,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this phone in April 2011 as a present. So the shipping was fast and I thought that Amazon sells only legit products, but I was wrong.After I got the package, I opened the box turned it on, started to browse default videos, but suddenly it turned off and began to restart. I thought ok may be because it is new it needs time to adjust. Then I give this phone as a present for a birthday, and shucks this person calls me after several weeks and says that I bought a forgery product because whenever she opens an application the phone restarts itself. Whenever you talk on this phone it restarts, she watches video from memorable event, restarts again. So, now this person thinks that I bought it somewhere on a black market and stopped to talk to me.Thank you Amazon for such a wonderful waste of my $400.'),(208,'B003ZX7RL4','I have to say that I had my doubts about purchasing this product post-the Elop announcement - but in the end I caved in and received a powerful smartphone with a spectacular  optical lens.  Rather than extolling the virtues of the hardware I will comment, having been an owner of an N85 in the past, that Nokia\'s Symbian ^3 contains incremental improvements in UI and ease of use while still remaining to the delight of its fan base a very familiar OS to use.  The hardware of this device speaks for itself - those that also know how to take advantage of and feel familiar around Symbian will no doubt be entertained and satisfied.  As a precaution however, the N8 does NOT feel anything at all like an iPhone with respect to UI nor does it presume to command a similar resource rich environment as Apple\'s App Store.  In summary I was sold on this device with respect to a) an improved Symbian UI, b) a 12 MP Carl Zeiss optical lens and c) an unlimited use of Ovi Maps without data requirements from the network carrier.'),(209,'B003ZX7RL4','no problem with the transaction. Nokia has bad customer service. called them for the problem with the phone and they made me ship if for repair. then they said that it had water damage even though i had if only for 8 months and did not expose the phone to water. now the phone is a brick. read blogs on nokia website and a lot of the people had similar concerns. Nokia has done nothing to fix it. i would not recommend to buy this phone. i was a nokia fanatic and had owned all their N series phones until the N8 and this is the last one. i am never buying a nokia phone it this is the service i am going to get from them after spending 600 bucks and buying the phone as soon as it came out. my strong recommendation is you are thinking to buy this phone DONT!!!!!!!!!!!Nokia N8 Unlocked GSM Touchscreen Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation and 12 MP Camera--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver/White)'),(210,'B003ZX7RL4','I dont want to repeat what others have written here. This is an amazing phone, perfect screen space, awesome camera, offline maps, free navigation. The only problem, this phone doesnt work correctly with Wind Mobile (Canada). The phone keeps on freezing and restarting, and this problem was noticed with the Wind Mobile SIM only. On other SIMs, this phone was just fine. Until Nokia fixes that part, I wont think of buying this phone again.(I returned the phone due to this incompatibility)Update: WARNING! Anyone using Nokia N8 on T-Mobile, do not upgrade the OS to Symbian Anna. Symbian Anna breaks the 3G functionality on TMobile![...]'),(211,'B003ZX7RL4','This phone packs with 12mega pixels and HDMI slot and most important of all, Nokia\'s menu and applications, which is by far still the most friendly menu system than any other smartphone.  I still don\'t like their camera portion of the phone having to always portrude so whenever it lays flat its prone to having its lens scratched.  Minor detail.I\'m enjoying it.  All I buy are unlocked Nokia cellphones and resell them to get new ones.  The last I had was an N900 and it was not so bad.  Bulky.  But this N8 is by far very sexy and thin, lighter than the iphone 4.  Symbian OS is much better than the Nokia N900\'s Maemo OS.  Much smoother going from one screen to another and one app to another.  I\'ve had some glitches with the Ovi store but I\'m getting help from Nokia Care via email.  They\'re great for that.Nokia N8 is definitely worth the money, shouldn\'t have to pay more than $425 or else its not worth it.  Amazon had the best deal.  Bought this phone from Amazon.com with free shipping/2day delivery as a Prime member.Overall, I would grade this phone an A for Excellent, simply because I\'m in love with the design and I love the Symbian OS.  Its all about the Operating System.'),(212,'B003ZX7RL4','Reading some of the reviews here comparing this to some Android and iPhone; I felt I had to add my two cents and a few points. I have owned all types of cell phones and this is the one I use daily. (iPhone 3,4,Galaxy S, etc...)1) This phone\'s MAIN function, being a TELEPHONE is flawless! SUPERB call quality, and no network drops. That\'s right fruit lovers, a phone that WORKS!2) This phone has only a 680mhz main CPU. TRUE, but it doesn\'t NEED a faster processor = more battery LIFE.3) This phone has only a 256mb main RAM. TRUE, but it doesn\'t NEED any more due to the efficiency of Symbian^3 = more battery LIFE.(RAM consumes power for those that didn\'t know)4) This phone has dedicated graphics processor which makes it very snappy, your 1Ghz CPU phone doesn\'t...5) GPS module is good->great with FREE lifetime navigation. (Nokia owns the world\'s LARGEST map company; NAVTEQ, for those that didn\'t know)6) Pentaband network; FM receiver/transmitter; Bluetooth 3.0; Wi-Fi G/N; integrated VOIP. This phone connects to virtually anything made by man, anywhere in the world.7) HDMI + Dolby output, 12Mp camera. This phone takes photos and videos in very good quality.8) I will be the first to admit Symbian^3 isn\'t the most intuitive UI at the moment, but there are 2 planned updates for 2011 Q1 and Q3.9) OviStore is still in it\'s growing phase, but it is getting better and much of it due in part to this phone.10) I would highly recommend the OtterBox case for this, not the one Amazon lists in the buy together.OtterBox Impact Case for Nokia N8Hope this helps clear some things up for you, I obviously like my phone and just had to buy another for my wife because she would not leave mine alone.'),(213,'B003ZX7RL4','this is my second Nokia, first one i had was N72....needed some other phone after my Samsung Galaxy.... thought to give it a shot....really good phone....so far no problems that i am concerned abt.....Nokia is a good and trusted company.... the only thing i wish if they also had google market instead of ovi.... but so far not having any complaints....phone is working fine and have lots of app. also ordered the sd card for extra memory....it do takes a lot of time to transfer any movies in the phone....as it converts and transfer....don\'t have much to say now for the phone....will probably update after a while abt it.....UPDATE SEPT. 26 2012SO, IT\'S ALMOST 2 MONTHS SINCE I HAD THIS PHONE. THE BEST FEATURE OF THE PHONE IS THE CAMERA. 12MP & CLARITY IS AWESOME, U DON\'T NEED ANYTHING WHEN YOU HAVE THIS.BUT LAST FEW DAYS I STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS AS IT WASN\'T ACCEPTING SIM CARD. I DON\'T HAVE A CLUE ON EARTH WHY OR WHAT WAS THE REASON. I JUST TRADE IN WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY S II.PLUS N8 FREEZES A LOT WHILE DOING SOMETHING. IT WAS JUST GETTING ME PISSED OFF BUT I HAD TO STAY CALM ON THAT PART.WELL GOOD LUCK GUYS WITH THAT ONE CUZ WHAT OTHER THING I HEARD THAT NOKIA IS NOT GOOD IN MAKING SMART PHONES. I LOVED THEIR N72 THO.N8 FOR ME, LASTED JUST AROUND 2 MONTHS.'),(214,'B003ZX7RL4','This is a major step back from previous Nokia phones. Nokia pc suite is no longer supported so you can\'t even back up your calendar unless you install Microsoft outlook (which I will never use for anything else). The phone is constantly locking up, the calendar is useless (if you move between time zones it changes all of the times in your calendar making you late or early!). I\'m irritated every time I try and use this piece of junk (4 months now). I\'ve owned several Nokia phones including the Nokia n95 and Nokia n86. This phone is a step back from both of those. There is literally not a single thing on this phone that works correctly (for instance if you exit a conversation before the text is fully sent it will send it to someone else at random!). DON\'T BUY IT!'),(215,'B003ZX7RL4','ordered from nokiaUSA, my first impression, broken headphones are sent, device itself is thicker than i expected,  neither ovi store nor the symbian programs are satisfactory, hd video is only good, after 5 days use, it started to restart itself, then i was looking for the nokia technical service places which the two of them already closed in the nyc. then i called them, they directed me to somewhere, then again after 2 days use, it again started to give autotomatic endless restarts, then i immediatley decided to send it back. i am still waiting(23 days) the confirmation of the refund, if they accept the refund, then  i should wait for 30 business days, which means if u can get a refund, u might get it in three months, i wanted to rate the product \'0\', but there is no such option.'),(216,'B003ZX7RL4','This phone is great i have nothing bad to say about this phone but the customer service lacks in every category that makes this phone a 1 star. First of all NokiaUSA is just a bunch of idiots they do not fix nothing, they will return your broken phone to you even if is still under warranty and they do not care that you spent 400$ for a cell. Compared to Apple customer service is like night and day Apple will swap any phone or ipad broken screen or not. They lost my phone under warranty on their possession and they do not want to give me a replacement for it. Their customer service in India is so bad i have to call the corporate office in NY. They still have not replace my phone that was lost by them. DO NOT BUY A NOKIA PHONE IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS TO HAPPEND TO YOU.'),(217,'B003ZX7RL4','After updating to Symbian Belle, I have to say, this is the nicest smartphone I have ever seen.It is now 2014, and I still am using mine after 4 years, and I bought one for my dad.I have no desire to \"upgrade\" to anything that is currently on the market. I see the prices for them new are going down to $160, which seems like a pretty good deal for one now, even if there is no more \"support\" for it from Nokia.It has features that most other smartphones *still* do not have, such as a micro-SD card slot, FM transmitter, 12mp camera, and HDMI output.Because of the AMOLED screen, it can show you the TIME when the thing goes into stand-by, so it\'s also a clock.The battery life is pretty good. Standby lasts 4 days if you don\'t use it much.The camera is by far the best camera you will find in a phone.They re-added the timed profiles feature which I found missing in earlier revisions of the Symbian^3The media player is greatly improved after upgrading to Belle. You can create playlists with it.The built-in FM transmitter means you can play music anywhere that there is a radio.That means your car doesn\'t need bluetooth or even a AUX IN jack, and you can hook up lots of boomboxes to throw an outdoor party with it.I don\'t see this feature in very many newer smartphones. I guess it is assumed all cars have bluetooth in them and you wouldn\'t need it for any other reason.The Location/Maps application works great. Sometimes it takes a while to get a fix if you don\'t have a data plan, but it does work without a data plan!! You can download all the maps offline and search offline.It is a little slower than the modern phones of today, and for web browsing or e-mail the screen is too small, but I don\'t want a big tablet in my pocket all the time!It\'s a camera you can keep with you and leave ON and in standby without sapping too much juice.And it does HD video too. Not to mention its HDMI output which may be handy if you have some video or presentation you want to give.Oh, and did I mention it\'s a pretty good phone too?I wish Nokia still made phones like these.You can\'t install any android or ios apps, but there are still tons of good apps for it.My biggest gripe is this: I wish the battery was removable. I was able to do it after watching a youtube video but it shouldn\'t be built-in like that.'),(218,'B003ZX7RL4','I promise that this will be my last review of this phone. I was very disappointed that the first one failed in 31 days. However, Amazon refunded ALL my money, and I made a point of buying another one from them, rather than a slightly cheaper one from an Amazon affiliate store. BIG difference! The replacement phone was NEW, as opposed to \"used\" as was the one from the Amazon affiliate store. I know that because:1. The box on the Amazon replacement phone was sealed with a little blue \"Nokia\" factory seal.2. ALL of the accessories were in the box, and they were all sealed in bags. Both of the 6-inch long USB adapters were missing from the first phone, and the bags that were in there were sealed with Scotch tape.3. The protective stick-ons were super tight on the AMAZON phone. The ones on the \"affiliate store\" phone had been obviously re-applied, with large air bubbles under them.4. Last but NOT least: The games on the phone that failed were already set up for the German language, and the menus and screen display said \"T-Mobile.\" I had to do all that setup stuff from scratch with the new N8 from AMAZON.The first phone also had the \"No camera sound\" option, but the American market one from Amazon did not. That means the first one was a Euro market phone.So it\'s all good now. The phone is amazing, and the photos embarrass those from other smartphones. Sometimes the interface gets a little sluggish, and the screen goes black for a few seconds, but my son\'s iPhone 4s screen freezes, forcing him to turn it off and back on (I have to do that sometimes too). Part of my problem is that I have over 800 photos on my phone, and a lot of apps, which burden the processor. Did you know that the sensor in the N8 is .802 inches diagonal (21.5mm), not under a half-inch like those in other smart phones and even most point-and-shoot megazooms? So the digital zoom on the N8 works well without excessive pixilation. And then there\'s the great and fast offline GPS, and the 802g/n WiFi, and the build quality, and the FM broadcast, and the 16 gb internal memory, and the extra memory card capability, and the standard, replaceable battery.STANDARD, REPLACEABLE BATTERY, you\'re thinking. Is this guy mad? No,look on youtube, or download the free Nokia N8 service manual. If you can change your car\'s tail light bulb, you can do it. You just need a small Torx screwdriver, and some basic fine motor skills. The battery is an off-the-shelf BL-4D. Another thing that most people don\'t know is that the flash on the N8 will trigger a Xenon \"slave\" flash, which greatly improves picture quality in dark settings. I use a little Vivitar DF-120 flash that\'s about a third the size of the N8 (but it\'s thicker). It worked perfectly at a party in a Marriott banquet room, which got me designated the official cell phone photographer. You know that TV commercial where the Samsung Galaxy III owners touch phones to exchange playlists, while the iPhone users look on in amazement and jealousy? You should have seen my co-workers at that party when I used my N8 and my shirt-pocket Vivitar slave flash. You can even hold the slave flash at arm\'s length to avoid the red/white eye problem that haunts most phone cameras. The FM broadcast blows them away, too. Our office pool cars have basic FM stereo radios, but no matter! I just tune to an unused station slot, queue up one of my favorite playlists, or Internet radio, and rock on! You just have to set the phone somewhere near the radio. How do other smartphone owners survive without that feature?TWO must-have apps: Joiku WiFi hotspot, and Camera Pro. Trust me. I have the last version of Symbian ANNA on my phone, and they work great. The Joiku hotspot app is the best I\'ve ever used. Very fast throughput and a cool, useful control panel. Camera Pro takes awesome pix (same as the OEM app), and you can turn off the red pre-focus light and the shutter sound.UPDATE JUNE 21: I now regret purchasing this capable but \"glitchy\" phone. My next phone will not be a Nokia. ONE DAY after my 30-day return period with AMAZON ended, the bottom 2mm charging socket went dead. The USB mini-port still charges, but in 2 days I head to Ocean City for a week, so now I have to buy a universal USB charger kit at BB so I can use the phone on vacation. Then it\'s back to Nokia because Amazon won\'t take it back unless I agree to take a bath on the credit. I\'m a professional engineer, so this was not abused (ie: I don\'t throw my phone around or beat people on the head with it), and I only charged it at home or in my office with the approved Nokia charger. Resetting the phone only cost me my shortcuts: It had no effect on the charging pin. I repaired over 300 laptops when I worked for a computer company called Odyssey, and I\'ve rebuilt or repaired numerous cellphones, iPods, and iPhones, so I\'m very familiar with small electronic devices. The pin socket is not loose or damaged. This appears to be a board-level component failure. My web research indicates that there are fusible links on the main board that can open up, and this is most likely the cause. My Nokia chargers work great with my Nokia-China made N82, which thankfully I kept. I thought the Finnish factory phones were better quality?In the beginning, the only thing that acted weird was the flash on the camera: It didn\'t work at first, but then it started working great, and that ushered in a 4-week period when everything was good. AT&T; did discover that I was using a \"Smartphone\" with a standard SIM card, but they allowed me to do the $10/month unlimited data plan because I\'m the primary accountholder and I\'ve been with them forever.All-in-all, this phone is a big disappointment. The N9 is probably just as bad. It\'s time for me to ditch Nokia!By the way, after the factory reset a lot of built-in applications like the photo viewer and camera button didn\'t work. After playing with the settings, they magically started working again. Also, when I received the phone, the stick-on labels had obviously been re-applied by a previous owner. When people return devices within their 30-day free trial, Amazon and its sellers should be honest and label them \"refurbished\" like the cell phone carriers do.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis is my first touchscreen-only phone, and I\'m still in a learning curve. But it\'s not the phone\'s fault. I have very dry skin, so every touch screen I\'ve tried, including the iPhone, is buggy with me. I restore vintage electronic tube gear, so the dry skin has probably saved my life a couple times.From a build quality standpoint, this phone very solid. The little plastic doors for the SIM and memory cards are typical cell phone quality, but the case is very solid. WARNING: the case is very slick, so when you order the phone, order an Otterbox or similar case at the same time, or you WILL drop the phone.Here are some pros and cons:PROs:- Real GPS that finds satellites even in the men\'s room at my office. I downloaded the entire US and Canada for free in about 2 minutes using my home network.- Real WiFi, that works for free in a million malls, fast food places, coffee shops, and the like all over the country. Why pay for the cow when you can get the milk for free?- Great signal strength if you go to Settings and set it to 3G. Until I did that, mine didn\'t get reception down in my basement clubroom. Now it gets 3-5 bars.- Loud, clear speakerphone. I use my phone for small meetings sometimes so this was important.- If you have a standard phone account, and you just slip in your SIM card, AT&T; doesn\'t call you and force you to buy a data plan. Also, the phone doesn\'t brick within 30 minutes. Stick a standard SIM card in an iPhone and you\'ll see what I mean. Just kidding, don\'t do that. You\'ll have to take it to the Apple Genius bar and have it reprogrammed.- The camera. Go to Flickr or some other photo sharing site and look up pictures taken with the Nokia N8. And the videos are the best 1280x720\'s I\'ve seen, at least in a phone. Photo sharing sites don\'t do them justice unless you download the videos and view them from your computer\'s hard drive because Flickr, Youtube, and others can be jerky with videos. Outdoor pictures rival most pocket cameras. I used my N8 at my daughter\'s end-of-season soccer team party and no one can believe I was using a cell phone camera until they check \"properties\".- If you had an N82, ALL of your accessories will work with this phone.- Uses a 3.5mm headphone jack. Has an HDMI connector and the cable comes with it.- The phone charges from a charger or the mini USB cable.- The audio volume control is truly variable, instead of in \"steps\".- Has the same cool music player interface features as the iPod touch and iPhone, etc. Shows the dates of groups of pictures, the alphabet letter of music albums, and so forth.- All sorts of voice commands but I\'m still learning about that.- 16 GB internal mass memory- The adaptive touch screen for texting is impressive.- It doesn\'t make that annoying \"dit-dit-ditdit\" sound when I send a text and I\'m at my computer (like other phones do) so the shielding must be good.- BATTERY: This uses a standard BL-40 battery: It\'s just internal. All you need is a #4 Torx screwdriver. There dozens of diagrams with instructions online. Bottom Line: If you\'re smart enough to use a smartphone, you should be smart enough to change this battery.- Too many other features to discuss here, but the main ones are above.CONS:- Slippery case. Get a nice rubber skin case, or suffer the consequences.- The new Belle OS upgrade supposedly has a better texting keyboard, but it has bugs in other areas.- The audio volume for the Music player is too low, so you have to use high-efficency headphones. Even my UltraSones aren\'t as loud as I\'d like.- The external speaker isn\'t as effective as the twin stereo speakers on the N82- I haven\'t found a way to alter the pre-set music equalizer settings, but there\'s probably an app for it.- No standard Bar Code reader, but there ARE several apps for that, including some that some claim are as fast as dedicated code readers.All in all, a great choice if you have an existing T-Mobile or AT&T; account and just want to buy a phone and slip in your SIM card. And the price is very good now that the N9 has gained a foothold. I still wish Nokia had finished their design for the \"N99\", because it had a keyboard, but I guess that was a pipe dream.By the way, when I see negative product reviews, I immediately read them to see if it\'s the product, or the reviewer. Phrases like \"It don\'t turn on\" or \"this phone no gud\" in a review indicate that maybe the reviewer was just in over his/her head.'),(219,'B003ZX7RL4','Lo recib&iacute; en mi pa&iacute;s el d&iacute;a 24 de diciembre y ya con una semana de uso puedo decir que es un equipo espectacular. La realidad es que me esperaba menos, siempre los equipos Nokia que he tenido han sido algo lentos y toscos, pero este es r&aacute;pido y elegante en las transiciones y funcionamiento. Realmente SYMBIAM 3 ha usado muy bien la velocidad del procesador y la memoria disponible.Lo que m&aacute;s me gusta del equipo es la rapidez y la fluidez con la que navego por las diferentes opciones, cosa que me place de sobremanera ya que mis anteriores equipos, N95 y N97, eran bastante lentos. Los juegos son espectaculares, en 3D y super sencillos de jugar. El reproductor de m&uacute;sica es excelente, hicieron un gran trabajo, muy elegante y sencillo de usar. La visualizaci&oacute;n de fotos y videos es genial, finalmente puedo ver mis videos AVI y WMV sin problemas, adem&ntilde;as puedo ver MPEG y los MP4. La c&aacute;mara es demasiado poderosa, la detecci&oacute;n de caras es lo &uacute;nico que no he podido probar, pero el video y fotos de paisajes han sido impresionantes. Menci&oacute;n especial para la pantalla que finalmente hace que sea realmente TOUCH y no PRESS SCREEN como la del N97.Lo &uacute;nico que no me agrada mucho es que solo tienes una salida de audio, que a pesar de sonar duro y n&iacute;tido esta ubicada en un punto donde por lo general siempre est&aacute; cubierta o por el forro o por el sitio donde coloque el m&oacute;vil.

The Doby surround sound is a great feature and I was delight about the quality from the first time I heard it.

For example, you may be playing a song (and its application window shows song, controls, etc), then below that window you can have you email that updates as new email comes, in another window you can see your social media updates and activity on real time, etc. and the phone works like that in all applications.- Camera: Excellent picture quality in photos and video (12 M / 720 p)- Full customizable screens, icons, short cuts, menus, etc. No limits!- All 3G and GSM Bands possible- SIM LOCK FREE! This means, that when you travel internationally, you can buy a \"Pay as you go\" SIM Card and use the mobile phone locally (also to use wireless data and use Skype or any other application)- Many applications (productivity tools) that Apple and Android would sell you, are free in Nokia OVI- Great battery duration, excellent voice quality and very, very stable- Very productive phone: It gives you many options for any application, for example, it lets you choose what to do and how, for example, if you are going to play your music files, you can choose to transmit that music in FM to your car stereo, etc- HDMI output, so if you load a movie, video, etc. or simply watching videos from the phone, you can connect a HDTV monitor or TV straight from the phone!The only feed back that I have for Nokia is they need to update the Youtube application, of course, Nokia didn\'t developed it since Symbian is too open and independent developers can upload those applications, but besides that, it is in general terms....BETTER THAN iPhone 4: I have BOTH phones> iPhone 4 with AT&T; and Nokia N8 with T-Mobile....and guess which is more productive? Nokia!BTW: You know who uses my iPhone 4 instead? My kids just to play games...and I don\'t let them touch my Nokia :)I just hope Nokia won\'t destroy this freedom on their phone after Windows software comes.

Almost immediately I realized that the colors weren\'t as crisp and the darks were slightly off. At first I thought it was a camera issue, but then after downloading the pictures to the computer and viewing on a different screen, came to realize that the blacks and darker grays are displayed as purples. I went online and did a little bit of research and found out that most of the newer phones( manufactured in Finland after Dec2010) have this issue. There are some tests you can do see if you have this issue, the purple hue is clearly visible in the upper half of the analog clock screensaver and the \'unlock\' box.This does not affect the functionality of the phone or the camera, but if you a detail-oriented person like me, it\'s something you will have to see everyday and that can be very annoying.

Firstly, it is not very well suited to the Symbian 3 platform which can make using the menus a time consuming exercise, worst of all being the phone book when making calls.The menu system itself does not close properly and often \"closed\" applications remain open after exiting.The phone is constantly trying to set the internet access to \"automatic\" via the cell network, an annoying feature, as by preference I will always use WiFi connections.The battery life on my phone is much shorter than advertised, 1-2 days, with low to moderate use without internet.The reception on the phone is also poor, having had to swap my SIM into a friend\'s Blackberry to receive an important call in an area of poor reception!Overall, I have owned Nokia\'s for 15 years but wish I had not bought this one.'),(226,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this phone for as what I thought to have been an upgrade from my Iphone 3gs after having read rave reviews of the phone and its listing by Amazon as being a top rated phone. This phone is a complete and total utter disappointment and p.o.s.! This phone has been nothing but headaches, drama and stress with less than two months of ownership! First of all, the phone freezes, shuts off and turns itself back on, downloads and app don\'t fucntion. The phone stalls when browsing the web and opening apps. I\'ve had to reset the phone three times and finally, the phone had to be sent for service. Now I will be without the phone for another two weeks or more! Even the apps suck! They offer no mainstream, common American apps! Everything is either European or Pakistani or Middle Eastern! The app store is limited. Customer service isn\'t at all knowledgeable and they don\'t respond in a timely fashion when your issue has to be escalated to a higher level tech support. I had to wait almost a week to receive the prepaid UPS label to send my phone back for service! The only saving grace to the phone is the 12 megapixel cam! The pic quality is amazing. I haven\'t tried connecting the phone to my tv via the hdmi cable yet nor have I recorded video but I\'m sure if those features function properly or are similar to the quality and functions of the camera, then I\'m sure they\'re great. All in all, I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT recommend this phone! I would have given the phone a one and a half star rating which would have been between \"I hate it\" and \"I don\'t like it\" ONLY because of the quality of the cam. Save yourself the trouble and disappointment and if you want an unlocked quality smartphone, just invest the extra $200-$375 and get the Iphone 4s, 5 or Samsung S3 or Note or Note 2! If the 12 megapixel cam is a must have, then you\'ll be sacrificing the other features and apps. Personally, I\'ll be ditching the N8 for the Samsung Note 2 and I\'ll have no problem spending the extra $375 for it unlocked! As far as the cam, 8 megapixel may or may not be a significant difference in quality than 12 but at least the Note 2 will have both a rear and front facing lens! BEWARE AND YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!'),(227,'B003ZX7RL4','I played a few days with the camera of the N8. It\'s just plain excellent, macro imaging, panoramas and so on all function very well (and new apps seem to be coming to further improve the usages of the camera!). It\'s also easy to launch as there is as separate button for the camera. I\'d strongly recommend for anyone looking for a backup for SLR  or just looking for a compact camera. N8 fits your pocket very easily, the lens is quite well protected and you can buy extra cover if needed. And there is enough space + networking + apps to easily get the images to photoshop, flickr etc.I was also pleasantly surprised by the media player and other features of the phone. The only thing I don\'t really like is the swiping \"feature\" of lagging switching of the home screen. Also, I\'m expecting an improvement for the basic web browser - however this is easy to come by by switching the default browser to Opera which you can find from Ovi store.'),(228,'B003ZX7RL4','this phone does not send text messages with AT@T, NOKIA does not have a fix, their \"fix\" is temporary.

I got it because it has a decent flash like the N82 but has a bigger screen.Good:- The phone felt very solid. The finish and fit were great.  I liked the small touches such as the chamfers around the buttons on the right.- The camera and video capabilities.- Connected to wifi, bluetooth, and USB faster and easier than the N82.- The phone itself was clear and got reception in places where my old phone didn\'t.- Multitasking was good.  I could have pretty much as many applications as I wanted open without any noticeable lag.- The gps and maps were much faster and include directions.Bad:- The symbian3 did not seem to a whole lot different than the old symbian on the N82, not that I had major problems with the old version. I just expected more obvious visual improvements/updates as compared to a 3-year old phone. Scrolling and swiping worked fine. I never found it \"unintuitive\" as others claim.  I find I-phones unintuitive but that is because I don\'t use one on a regular basis.- The Podcasting application was gone. The way the music player handled podcasts also was not as good as the old. Podcasting with the N82 was a pain to setup but worked great after that. With the growing popularity of podcasts, I was hoping the application would have kept and improved, not gotten rid of.  There was a different free podcast program available from symbian, but it was not good IMO.- There was a dead spot on the screen.I returned the unit because of the dead spot. I probably would have kept it if it didn\'t have the defect.  I may get another one in the future (or wait for the E7)if the podcasting program returns and more firmware improvements are made. I currently don\'t see enough improvements over my N82 to justify getting another the current price.'),(230,'B003ZX7RL4','It\'s been about 10 months I have the smartphone N8.The main problem I see on this smartphone is that it often crashes for no apparent reason. The screen freezes, and after a few seconds it turns off and on automatically. So at least once a day the phone does a kind of reboot. And mainly, when I need to use the phone at that very moment, as you can imagine.In the motion sensor mode enabled, the screen quickly rotates from one side to the other with small changes of phone position. So, it may be somewhat tricky to type a message, and one must keep the phone quite still in hand. It\'s very annoying. No comments about on screen keyboard. Iphone is incomparably better in this regard.The touchscreen is very sensitive to touch and a little inaccurate. You can easily tap into an application or a key that you had no intention to. I am 6 feet tall and I have an average finger size, so I think this is an issue that many other users may have been experiencing.Bizarrely, from time to time, one applications seem to open like spontaneously, without any command. Again, very annoying.Also, the response time of the phone is somewhat slow, that is, from tapping to have the application open and fully functional it takes long seconds.On the other hand, the utilities that I understand more positives are the GPS, which is very accurate and captures the satellite quickly, and the 12MP camera, which is awesome.Peace and blessings.Update: February 11th, 2012. Nokia provided a very nice OS upgrade. The phone became smoother, the screen less sensitive. And I have not experienced those blackout any more, expect just one time last week. This was a superb improvement! Keyboard became now a decent one, and screen outfit can now be easily configured with nice stylish buttons. I have just became someone about to like the phone after those improvements! Very nice job Nokia! Keep on improving it! For now, I keep it four stars.Peace and blessings.'),(231,'B003ZX7RL4','I\'ll not get into the debate about which smart phone has the best operating system, the most apps or the fastest processor as I could care less.I wanted a great camera phone and this is the best one - hands down.

If you want to play games, or talk about the latest app you don\'t really need, or need an Apple product just to say you have one, then you probably won\'t buy this phone no matter how good ( or bad ) the reviews are anyway.As for me, I love my Nokia N8 and wouldn\'t trade it for any other phone on the market today.'),(232,'B003ZX7RL4','Ordered what I thought was a new phone.

I had a Nokia n85 for two years. Earlier this year it started giving me trouble with the screen, it would black out while the phone was still on. I heard about the N8 and became extremely excited about it. For about the last three months the only way I could use my old phone was by plugging it into the TV and using that as the monitor, but I was set on waiting for the N8 so I dealt (even though its release date kept getting pushed) finally the time comes its available for pre order! I go to nokia.com to order the phone and a problem occurs and the order is canceled... ok I\'ll just order again right... NO I can\'t because the order was canceled Nokia won\'t let me order it for another month cause no one can tell the system what to do (especially in India) so my account is on some sort of system hold. Apparently the system can do whatever it wants and no one has any control over it! I tell them \"I\'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU MONEY AND YOUR TELLING ME THE SYSTEM SAYS NO!!!\" \"Please try again in a month sir\".Ok so whatever I\'ll order it from Amazon to see if it becomes available to me sooner (I need a phone!) Great, Amazon says it\'s ready sooner than anticipated!Get the N8Ok so I receive the phone and get to hold it in my hands after months of starring at pictures and videos of it, exciting! Follow the proper procedure charge it first then insert the SIM and memory cards and turn it on. Ok its starting up... no, no ok turn it on again, there it goes, great! Oh look there\'s an update ok... wait the phone is rebooting... ok let\'s try that again, wait no rebooting again. Ok let me just let it sit there for a moment. I grab my laptop to see what others are saying about it. Guess what, my phone isn\'t the only one that randomly reboots over and over again, but some of these people are saying that it went off and won\'t turn back on, check my phone, sure enough it\'s off and won\'t turn on. I give it an hour and it turns on. Right away I plug it into the comp and reinstall the software version just in case then I sync it on OVI. The next morning I see the phone rebooting on my night stand, I give the benefit of the doubt \"I\'m half asleep who knows what I saw\" I say. Works fine for the first full work day. Next day around 1pm I\'m having lunch and the phone on the table reboots, and then again and again. Time to call India (Nokia customer care) \"let\'s try restoring factory setting sir\" ok I\'ll humor them and ask him for his direct number so I can call from a diff phone \"just ask for an N8 specialist\" ok, so I hang up the phone and begin to enter the code, but the phone freezes and wont react and then turns off, and won\'t turn on. I call Nokia and explain again all that has happened, and add that I\'ve read others are having similar issues. \"Ok sir what we recommend is exchanging it where you purchased it from and hopefully we will come out with an update to fix the problem from happening again in the future\".ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!!!

Before I bought N8 I considered Android bases Samsung Captivate, Windows 7 based HTC HD7, Samsung Focus. None of them gives u as many goodies as N8 does. And for really affordable price as well. It hardly took time to configure this phone. Yes I did spent quite some time tweaking GPS configs until Satellite picked up the location. I installed couple of cool free apps from Ovi including Opera 10.1, Compass, Sticky notes. Configuring wifi on it was a zoom. Click click n go. Overall a delightful experience. Would recommend it if you need a highend smartphone for affordable price with goodies like free gps, HD recording, 12 MP camera, 16 gb memory! BTW dont be fooled by the processor speeds, N8 processor is more than enough for the efficient Symbion OS.'),(235,'B003ZX7RL4','Nokia N8 comes with Symbian Anna OS and it is optimized for a smartphone like this with easy-to-use interface. There are many good review about the endless features like the camera with xenon flash and autofocus, Bluetooth 3.0, HDMI with doldy digital output, 16 GB internal and slot for another 16 GB memory card, capacitive touch screen, operating system, GPS Free Maps and navigation (Very fast GPS triangulation), F-Secure, Adobe Reader, QuickOffice, Email with Microsoft Exchange support, Communicator, Corporate Intranet connectivity, Text-to-speech engine, one search tool to search phone content/web/maps/everything, 3.5G, Wifi tethering support. Great apps from Nokia store like Nokia situations, Panorama, Poynt, Angry birds, Wellness Diary, Spotify, etc.Only minor problems I experienced are: The proximity sensor seems to ditch at times and screen activates during a call. I endup accidentally disconnecting/muting the call by touching the screen. I understood that this problem exists in other brands which sport proximity sensor. Also the phone\'s loud speaker is housed in the camera/flash compartment which protrudes outward like a bump. So if you keep the phone faceup on soft bed or couch, chances are that you will not hear the phone ringing. Also the speaker is mono, no dual speakers for stereo as Nokia N900 has.Overall it is a very good device to own and I am completely enjoying the product.'),(236,'B003ZX7RL4','It has been a while since I wanted a Touchscreen phone and was considering the HTC Desire, the Samsung S8000Jet, Motorola Milestone XT720 and the Nokia N8. The iPhone is a great phone but just not the one of my taste.Why did I choose the N8? well, it has all that I wanted.I am currently outside the US and the 3G frequency here is 850MHz which narrows my options.The HTC: Only specific models has the HSPDA 850MHz (A8182 & A8183) which are quite difficult to find on Amazon, in fact I was not able to find one!The Samsung: Checked with a friend\'s phone and the signal coverage was not that good.The Motorola: Great phone (xenon flash, HDMI out, HD Video capability), but a bit too big to fit confortably in my handI currently own a Nokia E51 and it is a great phone, in over 2 years no issues at all and the signal coverage is amazing (My wife works at a school out in the mountain area, and where all the other phones(Samsung, LG, Motorola) have failed with the network coverage(screen shows searching for network) this one wins by far (80% signal strenght)Purchased the phone on \"Cyber Monday\" for $429. Got the \"Made in china\" one and was a bit worried based on the reviews I saw, but I\'ve had no issues at all with the phone(most of our electronic devices are made in China anyway). It even came with the updated firmware(RM596) and all the software updated as well (OVI suite shows \"No updates available\")Only some minor annoyances so far:1. Sometimes (less now than before) The screen will not respond to touch. I tap and tap and tap again and nothing, as if it was not aware that I was tapping or maybe I am not doing it correctly.2. Sometimes when I flip the phone, the screen will not rotate, I have to return it to portrait and then flip it and then it will rotate the screen. Amazingly, if the phone is on the table, as soon as I pick it up, the screen rotates!3. The home screen is a bit simple and you cannot place widgets side by side. Solved by installing SPB Mobile Shell4. The browser is not that bright so I use Opera Mobile 10 instead.5. No QWERTY keyboard in Portrait mode (weird as when using Opera, you get the QWERTY keyboard in portrait mode)6. No \"custom\" setting for equalizer as my E51 hasBedides these, which I can live with, the phone is working great. I get 100% battery after 1 complete day of usage. Power Saving Mode is nice to cutdown battery dain.Played Angry Birds, Neef For Speed Shift, Real Golf 2011 and Galaxy On Fire and they all ran flawlessly.Now, I can leave my Zen Multimedia Player(N8 Headphones have a great sound) and my Panasonic Lumix Camera at home as I have both features in the N8, plus, I can use it to make and receive calls.'),(237,'B003ZX7RL4','Con este telefono nokia de verdad se la comio su camara es demesiado brutal, la cantidad de opciones que te da a nivel de hardware es increible como su transmisor FM un estandar que deberia haber en todos los equipos, su Bluetooth 3.0, la gran conexion HDMI para sacar todo el potencial del HD y pare de contar y aunque muchos critican su software ya que no pueden criticar el hardware por que es increible hay una ventaja el software se puede modificar, arreglar y mejorar como ya lo han hecho con su proxima actualizacion la tan esperada Symbiam Anna a fin de este mes, pero en cambio el hardware no se puede cambiar mucha RAM mucho procesador para que, para que me habra algo un poquito mas rapido no que va eso no cuenta para mi prefiero un gran camara o un trasmisor FM o el USB ON THE GO que me parece fenomenal es definitiva es un gran equipo muy versatil que me da todo lo que me da los demas y mas por su abanico de posibilidades por eso he comprado hasta la fecha 4 Celulares de estos y todos estamos contentos, no lo piensen si desean este equipo es EXCELENTE usandolo en Venezuela......With this telephone nokia indeed the comio his(her,your) chamber(camera) is demesiado brutally, the quantity of options that gives you to level of hardware is incredible as his(her,your) transmitter FM a standard that deberia to be in all the equipments(teams), his(her,your) Bluetooth 3.0, the great connection HDMI to extract the whole potential of the HD and stops(stop) counting(telling) and though many(many people) criticize his(her,your) software since they cannot criticize the hardware for which it(he,she) is incredible there is an advantage the software can modify, arrange and improve since(as,like) already they it have done with his(her,your) near(next) update such an awaited Symbiam Anna in order this month, but on the other hand the hardware cannot change many RAM very much processor in order that, In order that me habra slightly a bit rapid mas not that goes it does not count for my I prefer one great chamber(camera) or a trasmisor FM or the USB ON THE GO that seems to me to be phenomenal is definitive is a great very versatile equipment(team) that gives me everything what gives me the demas and mas for his(her,your) range(fan) of possibilities because of it I have bought up to the date 4 Cellular ones of these and all are satisfied, do not think it if they wish this equipment(team) it(he,she) is EXCELLENT using it in Venezuela ......'),(238,'B003ZX7RL4','This is my first truly smart phone. Prior to this I had a Nokia Nuron (T-Mobile) and it was nice, but being a carrier branded phone, the OS was, in my opinion, crippled from having full functionality.However, this is not the case with the N8. Being unlocked, unbranded, and untouched by any carrier, allows this phone to have all of the functions it came with. Symbian^3 is a nice platform. Very easy to navigate, the included apps are very nice. The glass touch screen is as responsive as any other capacitive touch screen I\'ve tried. The colors and graphics are bright crisp, and very clear. Nokia\'s Ovi Store has a lot of apps to choose from, and the selection is getting better. Its not Apple\'s App Store, but its good enough for me. The camera is amazing. With 12mp resolution and 720p video, I found the photos, and videos extremely nice. I\'ve been a hobby photographer for 25+ yrs, and this is as good as any point & shoot out there, and you can make calls on it too.Overall, I recommend this device. I am sure there are nicer phones out there, but for my money, this is one of the best phones available.UPDATE (6-15-2011): I am having issues with the device after 2 months of ownership. Ovi Maps has a bug, and it is now crashing after charging overnight. Ovi Maps is not using its own updated traffic information to re-route itself. The updated traffic info is correct, but its directions were not using this info. Charging my phone overnight is leading to having to initiate a reset (sometimes twice) because it powers itself off and won\'t turn back on.UPDATE (7-22-2011): This phone has turned out to be a huge waste of money. All of the other issues remain per the first update. On top of the problems I had, now I cant make calls in my house unless I go out in the driveway. This might be a tiny bit inconvenient in January here in NW PA, where last year it snowed 140 inches. The phone drops calls, whenever it thinks I\'ve talked long enough to the party I called. If the call lasts longer than 5 minutes, its considered a long conversation. I bought this smart PHONE for use as a PHONE. If the phone part of this device is garbage, then the device falls way short. High res cameras, internet surfing, dont mean a thing to me, if I cant make a simple call. As stated before, I do photography. I already have nice cameras, I dont need another one. I just wanted a device that was a solid PHONE. The rest of the features, are gimmicks. They are nice to have, but when the phone part is junk, it doesn\'t matter.UPDATE (9-13-2011): It appears I was a tad hasty in my scorn for this device. Seems the issues with this device were provider related. Changing from T-Mobile to AT&T; has changed the behavior of the phone dramatically. Cellular coverage obviously is a huge factor to device function, and I should have tried that when I started having call issues. That said, it is working like a smart PHONE. Call reliability, and quality have improved. I now access internet where ever I am, whenever I need to. It still has some quirks, but what phone is perfect?UPDATE (12-5-2011): As much as I liked this phone, Nokia has some things to sort out. When they finally offered Symbian Anna (about 1-1/2 months ago), I did the update, then called them because it toasted my device. Their software bricked my phone. I dont know how or why, and I\'m not an expert on these devices. Prior to this, the N8 was a great device. However calling them was futile, because I tried everything they recommended, and nothing worked. I gave up on this device. Enter Apple iPhone 4S.UPDATE (7-24-2013): I acquired another (brand new) N8. This time the OS update was for Symbian Belle. Nokia seems to have gotten it right. Smoother, faster, bigger icons (better for older fingers) and less crashes.Is is perfect? No. Has any company made a perfect smart phone? Not yet. Because its all dependent on what the user wants out of the device. That said, I will say the updates to Nokia Maps is sweet. It rivals my dedicated GPS unit for the car. The Ovi Store is not as expansive as the App Store by Apple, but I got this device as a backup phone (prepaid service), so that is really not an issue. Its sad that this device is no longer produced, because what it offers (12mp camera, great maps app, nice mp3 player, decent browser, decent email) is fairly solid, and because its Nokia\'s OS on Nokia\'s hardware, the device remains pretty stable.If you can find one brand new give it a try. I gambled again, and like it.'),(239,'B003ZX7RL4','nokia\'s allure it\'s a great looking phone graphics are awesome has HDMI hook up .It has a built in radio transmitter witch means you don\'t use data to listen to the radio..Great!!

This phone runs the Symbian OS, which Nokia is abandoning for Windows Phone 7 (and Meego, perhaps). Symbian is not nearly as intuitive as its competitors, which is unfortunate because it is just as technically capable if not more so. The system is riddled with inconsistencies and haphazard placement of options. App availability and ease of installation is seriously lacking (the Ovi store is garbage).That said, multitasking is far superior compared to other systems, especially considering the hardware resources available on the N8. This is a byproduct of Symbian\'s longevity in the market (which is also the source of aforementioned consistency issues). Updates to the OS will be coming this year, but don\'t expect too much. Another byproduct of Symbian and the hardware is ridiculous battery life, considering the camera, flash, and various network connections.Think desktop Linux vs. Windows 7 or Mac OSX and you\'ll have an idea.Summary:Not many \"apps\" available. (Face it, most of you just download games anyway. Perhaps their lack of availability here will be a positive influence on your life.)Amazing camera (12MP, fast, real xenon flash), incredible at this price point. This alone makes the N8 a serious competitor for the price.Great battery life.GPS, maps, and navigation without an Internet connection for free. No more Google Maps failures when you were relying on it (see this constantly among iPhone users).Pentaband, works on any 3G/GSM network in the entire world (since you\'re buying an unlocked phone, this is probably an important consideration).Extremely durable casing with a Corning glass scratch resistant screen. With a rubber case you literally cannot break it unless you drop it in water.The only smartphone available in many different colors. Can you think of another smartphone that is orange, cyan, or magenta? Some really won\'t care about this, but I love that fact that it is orange. It is definitely not just another black rectangular solid.Need a phone that works everywhere, takes great pictures, has excellent battery life, is invincible, and can navigate in most countries of the world without a connection? Don\'t care about \"apps\"?If you meet that description, this phone is absolutely your best option at the moment.On an unrelated note, this phone proves Nokia still makes some of the best hardware out there. Microsoft made an excellent decision paying them a billion dollars (really) to switch to their platform. Don\'t write off Windows Phone yet.'),(241,'B003ZX7RL4','WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE!I purchased this phone because of the press I read about it. I\'ll be honest, having a phone with those capabilities was GREAT!The PROs:1. Great Camera! 12 mega pixels.. You just cant beat that as of now.2. Cool slick design.3. Fast.4. I love the FM transmitter.5. Great Video capture..... and a lot more!With all these nice things and more, why a 1 star and why DON\'T BUY IT?The CONs:1. User Interface (UI) - needs getting used to.2. Proximity Sensor - try using it on your left ear, the slightest movement will re-engaged the screen! WITH THE SCREEN ENGAGED, YOU CAN\'T MAKE A DECENT CALL! My cheeks keeps pressing either the MUTE, HOLD or HANG UP BUTTON! I waited for the update on the firmware but Nokia did not release a fix for it. I checked the internet for possible solutions and it seems that a lot of people have the same problem.Nokia Customer Support had no idea and I had to tell them where in the internet they can find the said problem. Now, it seems that I would be without a phone for more than 2 weeks because all they can do is to tell me to send the phone for repairs.If you want a phone that you can actually use to make proper calls, BUY ANYTHING BUT THIS!'),(242,'B003ZX7RL4','I own N82 - phone I purchased at Amazon as well and have been very happy with. I purchased N8 before Thanksgiving at $429 to be able to access T-Mobile 3G and get better GPS and camera, as well as larger screen and touch interface.I like N8, but I wish I waited with the switch until the firmware upgrade is available.The phone has some issues that are mostly software, not hardware related based on my exchanges with Nokia and reading various forum postings.The most annoying one is this phone\'s refusal to stop searching for WiFi when requested manually. I\'ve never seen it in any phone I have owned.The second is apparent incompatibility of some of the voice guidance files with the maps. My UK voice guidance works fine, but not US with street names, which is silent. Standard Nokia Tech advice - do hard reset. I wonder why Nokia even bothers employing Tech Support people. After dealing with them for 20 years I find them pretty much useless.The biggest problem that is not software related (I think - Nokia helpers have no clue - do a hard reset they say ?!) is very poor flash performance. My N82 has N8 beaten hands down. At 10ft distance my N82 photo is nice and sharp; the N8 photo is grainy. This despite of supposedly bigger N8 sensor and 12 MP versus 5MP.The HD video though works great, except for low light conditions again, and flash will not work with video.Overall I am sufficiently happy with the purchase to keep it. I\'ll use my N82 as a backup with other SIM cards when travelling. Again, I wish I waited till they resolve various bugs. I always liked Nokia and it is so dissappointing to see that they cannot get their act together. In Nokia Support forums Nokia reps are missing. This would have been great opportunity for the company to address some of the above mentioned issues. The fact that they are silent speaks volumes to their customer service committment.'),(243,'B003ZX7RL4','This is actually my second N8. The first one I bought in early May. After only a few hours of use it powered off for no apparent reason. Then each time I tried to restart it, it would shut down again after about 30 seconds. I was disappointed because it really is a beautiful phone. I kept looking for another phone that had everything I wanted and I couldn\'t find one - mainly I wanted a GSM penta-band with a good camera and internet capabilities. There was no other phone but the top of the line Nokias. So I thought I would try the N8 again (because it has 12MP camera with auto focus - otherwise I would have gotten the E7 with the larger display and the QWERTY keyboard). I am so happy I did. The first N8 which I sent back was produced in Dec. 2010. This second one was produced in March 2011, so maybe the bugs where fixed with the later models.  I just know my new N8 is exactly what I hoped it would be.  The call quality is excellent and the camera works beautifully. The customizing capabilities of the Symbian OS allow me many personalizing options. The display is bright and clear, and even in direct sunlight it\'s still readable; touchscreen response is fine; photo/video record quality is superb for a mobile phone (especially if you use custom settings); FM transmitter is a nice extra; HDMI Dolby works great; and video play/web TV is good. Even the speaker produces pretty good sound and has high volume. So, what could be better: Well, even though the processor seems to work fine for general use, I notice the more demanding apps are slow to load. Also, the Ovi store apps download process is a bit slow, too. The battery life is excellent, though, so maybe that would be the tradeoff with a faster processor. The RAM usage for me averages about 60% but maybe those who play the advanced games and want to have several apps open at the same time would like more RAM. Other than that, I really can\'t think of anything else Nokia could improve on. Because I read several reviews here sharing equipment failure comments, and because my first N8 was a lemon, I still have my fingers crossed that no problems will develop later. However, from my research, no mobile phones are free from problems - not even the Galaxys and the iPhones (which are much more expensive). I guess it is the luck of the draw. I have used both the Galaxy and iPhone, and still I prefer the N8 because of my needs and how well it has performed so far, which is why I am giving it 5 stars.'),(244,'B003ZX7RL4','Considering other phones include iPhone and Samsung Galaxy and all those HTC phones, i have no regret to choose this Nokia N8.Biggest thing is its camera.Better than iPhone 4s and the video quality recorded is impressed but the FPS is not enough for the smooth play.Another 2 things: HDMI output, Nokia PC Suit Co-op.The HDMI output makes the play of Video and Photo so much easier. And the interface of the software on the screen is cool and friendly. Also it can print the screen of the phone onto the screen, which enables that you can have a much larger screen for your phone when you are using it to web or even play games.Nokia PC Suit is so powerful. The most evaluate point is PC can access the Internet through N8 if N8 can access to Mobile Network. That allows my laptop to get the Internet everywhere.GPS, Applications can touch sreen are common advantages.Thinking about the price, the is the best phone i got.'),(245,'B003ZX7RL4','I had waited a while for this phone to be released when Nokia first announced it with the Symbian 3 OS. It has an unbeatable feature set and arguable the best camera to be found on a mobile phone, rivaling standalone point & shoot cameras. However, Symbian 3 proved to be quite a disappointment compared to the new operating systems around by then. That being said, for anyone used to Nokia phones, it was still an improvement.Quality of construction is superb, and it exudes an air of class about it including the choice of colours. Connectivity is unmatched with USB-on-the-go, HDMI output to TV which is amazing and shows great detail, and an FM transmitter that works better than many standalone FM transmitters on the market !! I streamed music through a car stereo recently, and could swear it was connected via cable, with no disruption whatsoever !! That may have a lot to do with us having no stations near the 90.0 band where I had it set, but once you find a channel that is free, this thing works in a jaw dropping manner !The whole major selling point of this phone has been the camera and it does not disappoint. It has now also been enhanced by the Symbian Anna update and now has continuous auto-focus in video recording.I finally decided to buy this phone over a year since its release for a couple of reasons which now make it a good bargain...Firstly, the camera is phenomenal and remains the best option thus far for anyone photo centric like me who might use a phone a lot as a backup when a real camera is not on hand;Secondly, because it never hit the expectation level it generated prior to its release, it has become available at a much discounted price from that it launched with, and..Thirdly and very importantly, the new Symbian Belle OS update has been promised for this phone and other Symbian 3 handsets before the end of the year, and the reviews that this version has been getting as well as numerous videos showing the N8 running on Belle shows a modern \'Android\'-like interface and a smoothness not yet seen on a Symbian phone. That update alone would make the N8 feel like a product just released and give it some value to come, along with the pending Microsoft Productivity Suite updates.As it is, Symbian remains very efficient on power use which means long battery life, and good at true multitasking. The current update reduces the amount of freezing experienced, and Belle should make a world of difference, that alone makes this phone a good value-for-money proposition especially with Amazon\'s price !'),(246,'B003ZX7RL4','I ordered this phone from Amazon and got it delivered in just 2 days, with free Super Saving Shipping. I got to tell that the phone has gone well beyond my expectations (in my first few days of use) and I\'ve started loving it since I received it. It has got a lot of features and will still take some more time for me to get acquainted with all the properties that the phone has gotten. The Look-and-Feel is great, impeccable screen resolution, smart Social Networking features and as some of the other users said, there seems to be some drag with the Symbian OS. Otherwise, the quality of the photos/videos with the camera is really outstanding, and it\'s one of the prime attractions in this phone. In short, everything seems to be OK at least for the time being...'),(247,'B003ZX7RL4','This wont be a lengthy review since i had the phone for a day before i returned it, to be honest i returned in a hurry because i knew if i kept it for long enough i would have ended up keeping it. The construction is just beautiful, the look and feel of the hardware is superb, cant say much about battery life since i didn\'t use it extensively, but i have used the E71 in the past and i reckon it should be pretty good (compared to my Evo 4G!!). Coming to the heart break part, the OS and the touch response of the phone is just not up to par for modern standards, IOS and Android are miles ahead, truth be told I use my phone more for the apps than for any other thing, even calling :) for which i use Skype.These days the UI has to be fluid and well thought out with a mix of widgets icons etc, IMHO it has to aggregate the huge amount of information phone users consume these days and present it in the most concise and speedy way possible, and Symbiam^3 achieves none of those. Lack of apps, the UI is dated, the browser is really awful the notion of using ovi integration for emails and other services is a total non starter and the list goes on. Hope WinNokia can get it right.'),(248,'B003ZX7RL4','I used to have the N97, and N8 way much better, faster, thinner, prettier and more responsive. Do not miss at all the 32 GB internal memory... with 16GB more than enough. I love the FM transmitter, every where you go you can turn on the party with the music going through a real stereo speakers, easy to transfer data, music, pics with Bluetooth, and best of all unlocked for the price!!! Excellent!!! buying it here in Ecuador with the cel service carrier will cost twice more.Add to the N8 the HDMI, the excellent 12Mp camera, the finish of the phone and the size of it not too, long not too wide, it is the perfect device to go a long with it everywhere. Thanks Nokia'),(249,'B003ZX7RL4','If you are looking for a fullly featured phone with a camera that can perform as good as a dedicated digital camera in the $200 range, fast WIFI, free navigation with offline maps, look no further.  This is your phone.  The display in on pars with other smart phones such as Android and iPhone4, which use AMOLED display with a notable exception of iPhone4\'s retinal display.  Night shots with N8 are not comparable to say a dedicated camera that is equipped with a much more powerful xenon flash.  In other words, if you do not resize the pics you snapped at night, then you will see noise (even my DSLR Nikon shows a little noise in poor lighting -- can you imagine a phone that is equipped with a much smaller xenon flash).  Call quality is outstanding with ear-piece volume really loud so no need to crank up the volume to max when you are in a noisy place.  UI is a little dated especially coming from Nexus One, but no worries you can download Nokia\'s Midnight theme to spice up UI and there are 50 improvements for Symbian ^3 on the way to make users experience even more commendable.  The virtual qwerty keyboard is a little slow like the Android 2.1 version.  With Android 2.2 version, it seems much faster than N8.  Like I pointed out, there are 50 improvements on the way, and one of these improvements might or might not address the issue with responsiveness of the qwerty keyboard.Now for quality control.  You have to be patient with N8 b/c you might end up a bad power management unit that is fully recognized by Nokia Corp. (just google it) and read the articles.  My first N8 was silver color and it would not even power on, so I had to exchange it (Amazon was very nice about this b/c they sent it overnight for the replacement -- that\'s customer service).  Unfortunately, the replacement, though works, had cosmetic issue on the inner bezel.  The blemish was naked eye visible that can be seen under bright lights, so I had to return the phone.  I ordered a black one now in the hopes that the black one is a later batch that Nokia may have addressed major issues.  The black ones seem to be purchased at higher demand and hence Amazon might have a new batch in their inventory.  My point is that I liked the phone over my Nexus One that I am giving Nokia a third chance and also the last.  I hope this review helps you.'),(250,'B003ZX7RL4','You\'ve probably read enough about the phones features here or in other reviews, I won\'t be discussing these too much since it seems rather redundant. I\'d rather share my current experience since I\'ve had the phone.* This phone or the more recent production batches of them seem to have a display issue in which the screens black levels look purple (magenta). This coloration doesn\'t seem to affect 100% blacks or at least is impossible for the eye to tell. Also, this happens under most lighting conditions, with the exception of outside daylight.Unfortunately, I did not this before I bought the phone, however this is an issue that has been thoroughly discussed throughout the web and Nokia\'s own support discussions both here in the US and in Europe. It seems that Nokia has not fully acknowledged this issue regardless of customer complaints. They have only expressed that they would keep a close eye on the problem, that\'s all. In other words, unless they have complaints by the majority of users, they are probably not going to bother to reach out to customers and you\'ll have to do all the time wasting, stressing and work.Anyhow, I called amazon and told them about the issue and they sent me another one asap. The second phone still has these problems.While I realize that most AMOLED screens suffer from slight blue/purple (magenta) coloration, this phone\'s issue goes beyond slight. A black and white photo should never look purple. I\'ve tested it with gray scale images from my computer and get the same results. Darker GUI (eg. buttons, tabs, etc.) elements should not look purple or extreme color banding. These are just specific scenarios, expect to experience this issue with videos, color images, etc.The specs state 16.7 million color display, however it looks like an 8-bit color display.My next option is to send it to Nokia Care, although I\'m a bit afraid because I\'ve read of many customers doing the same only to get the same faulty looking screen back.* The other issue with the phone, is that if you buy this phone U.S version, don\'t expect to get your OS updated anytime soon. Symbian Anna has been released for several months and released to many phones across the globe, except this one. Nokia has stated it\'s not yet available in the U.S even though this is not at all true. The Nokia E6 U.S version sold by Amazon comes with it pre-installed.*** The reason I\'m trying so hard to keep this phone (other good features aside) is because this is the only available phone out in the market that works with both AT&T; and T-mobile GSM networks.*** If I do get it repaired by Nokia Care I will come back and rate the phone 4-5 stars. If it weren\'t for these issues, the phone would out right deserve them.Hopefully this will hep your decision with your purchase, best of luck to you all.Thanks!'),(251,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this phone before the November \"Black Friday\" period since my \'ol faithful Palm Treo 680 was slowly failing me. As usual Amazon speedily ships my stuff in what is described as kinda simple basic packaging.This phone is what some consider a camera with a phone and it shows, fast AF, Xenon flash, 12 MP, 720p video- it\'s a pretty good/great phone-camera. The phone build is excellent, a 3 piece aluminum case with Gorilla Glass it feels heavy and solid. The specs isn\'t so much spectacular though in a market with 1Ghz 512MB models this is a bit sub spec or should I say mid spec but the Symbian^3 OS handles much with less CPU cycles and it\'s up to the task.The phone does lag in between but it\'s not frustrating, though one morning it completely froze on me and I had to restore it to factory defaults. Also had a phone call issue with it, callers would say that they hear a reverb on their end even when I have full bar signal strength and I was hearing them clearly. Amazon took care of that and re-issued me a replacement phone in one day flat!!! I still experience some call failures, but I decided to keep it I still have a full one year Nokia warranty so they can take care of it if needed. There are a lot of apps at the Ovi Store, enough to keep a guy happy since there is a lot of stuff pre installed on the phone when shipped. The built in maps are decent, you an also install maps from other countries if you decide to make a visit it\'s already there on your phone, spoken directions is nice and all free.HDMI out, USB on the go are some of the features that make this kick ass and it has built in FM receiver and FM transceiver, a lot of stuff under the hood. Geo tagging as well for taking a snapshot via camera and tagging it onto your maps is handy.The battery is excellent, since Symbian^3 is designed for lower CPUs it has great battery life compared to the Androids and iPhones. I work at a hospital and all my co-workers have Androids every single one and by half day they have to recharge the battery, not I. I don\'t have issues with my WIFI nor with my online widgets, they all work well RSS feeds, email no issues. Productivity is decent everything you need is pre installed on the phone- Quick Office, Adobe reader a highly customizable calendar.Closing off this review I would say that this phone is an excellent phone, I wished though that they would continue to support Symbian or at least release some polished updates as we now know that they are slowly closing the door on it. It has some quirks that I don\'t like in the UI too many steps to enter passwords while browsing the web etc.An update: I connected the phone to the Nokia PC Suite (2-13-2012)software to sync contacts etc, and got a recommendation from Nokia to update the phone\'s software to Symbian Belle. I went through the procedures, back up my phone etc and it began to install the Belle and then the PC Suite reported that it lost connection to the phone!!! The screen was completely blank and would not respond, holding down the power button did vibe the phone but it would not turn on.I really really wanted to use this phone but after all this I just lost confidence in buying/replacing it with another N8'),(252,'B003ZX7RL4','To make the long story short; I bought this device over a year ago. After 3 months, I realized that I made a horrible mistake buying it with a budget of $449!! The device is peace of crap. The battery life is a nightmare. Every time I call or contact the customer service; they were useless and advising you with some non sense instructions. I have to perform the hard reset every time to make the phone work properly again. I don\'t have the exact number how many time it froze. Browsing the web is a disaster, slow and bulky and the whole operating system is buggy and makes think million times before using it. Lately, Nokia Released an update called it Belle. I tried to upgrade the phone so I can save my investment. Accidentally my internet connection got lost. That was the last time I saw the phone working. I contacted them and asked me about the warranty and stuff. I was out luck for the second time ( the first when I was convinced to buy this phone). The warranty ended for two days. they done nothing and the phone now is eating dust in a bench; My computer doesn\'t recognize it  and I learned that the only thing to do is to re-flash it. I did everything I\'ve been told, but the phone is dead.'),(253,'B003ZX7RL4','Received the phone on the 9th of Feb and within one day signs of the shutdown problem began to arise. Progressed to where phone would VERY frequently freeze and shutoff during any activity (launching/using apps, dialing numbers etc). Added annoyance was the fact that I have to wait a few minutes to switch it back on. Restoring factory setup and reinstalling firmware did nothing to help the problem.Repair through Nokia would require mailing the phone in (no charge) and approx 10 business day turnaround which I\'ve read my not fully resolve the issue. The Nokia rep I spoke to said there is no option for local walk-in repair, phone must be mailed to the center in Texas. Yeaaaa no. Opted to get a replacement sent by Amazon and I\'m hoping my phone doesn\'t completely die before the replacement arrives.Even with this inconvenience, the recent Symbian news (notice the price drop) and possible implications for software update time lines and new apps the news may have, I opted for a replacement and not a refund because:Compatibility with T-mobile and it\'s 3G network, while being unlocked, at the price bracketMy first smart/touch phone so I have no bias towards any particular OS or navigation layout. Also has the support the the apps I could see myself using.Sturdiness of the phone\'s construction (somewhat ironic). Seems solidly built when held.Camera and HDMI out. I\'ve found that much situations arise when I need to record or take quality photos, with flash.*UPDATE*Replacement phone is functioning correctly.Phone home screens, icon order and hardware settings can be highly customized so any task can be completed with minimal inputs. E.g. one press launching of camera, voice recorder, live inbox status of multiple emails and social networks and a side-scrollable bar of key contacts.With the Situations app you can further customizes profiles allowing you to maximize battery life.Syncing files, messages and contacts with computer is swift and simple.Skype voicecalls workAdding words to the dictionary is problematic. Some words are retained, many words a person would commonly use aren\'t and there is erratic capitalization of added words. Greatly slows texting.Get the OtterBox case and you are set.'),(254,'B003ZX7RL4','This phone is very well made and feels great in your hand. The size is perfect. It came with the latest belle software installed. A couple of hours of playing with the settings, including adding widgets and shortcuts and I can completely control my data flow. I have dropped my data package as I really did not use it on my Atrix II. I went to the ATT store and switched my sim card back to my old Motorola Global that I never had a data package with and then went home and switched the sim to my N8 and turned off the data flow. I don\'t expect any problems with ATT. So now I have a perfect touch screen phone with wifi if needed and no data fees. The camera is outstanding. Looks like my pre purchase research has paid off! I downloaded Nokia suite and synced my computer with outlook for contacts. Installed my 16 gb micro sd card with my music and everything is working great. I also sent a couple of pictures to my computer with Bluetooth to test out. The Bluetooth syncs well with my 2012 Golf TDI for great hands free calling. Did I say it\'s well made. I do not think that there is a better quality phone out there. The operating system compares very well to android. I find the keypad to be very accurate.'),(255,'B003ZX7RL4','Before buying this product, I did my home work on this phone at various blogs, websites, user reviews, so I  knew what I can and can\'t expect.One feature I would stress on N8 is CUSTOMIZATION( a lot ).

I\'ll start off buy saying that 2 weeks ago this phone completely died on me (wouldn\'t turn on, wouldn\'t charge). After this fiasco not only am I completely disappointed with the phone itself but I am just as disappointed with Nokia customer service. After waiting a long 2 weeks for a new phone they didn\'t even send me a proper refurb. They sent me a \"new\" phone with my old casing on it. Seeing as my old username was stored on there I am hesitant to even believe the inside of the phone itself is new. As an Apple employee (I should have an iPhone I know) this is ridiculous seeing as we replace customer\'s nonfuctional phones with new ones or refurbs that are like new. Not to mention the fact that the woman I spoke to on the phone was completely unsympathetic about my problem. Having paid over $400 for their crap product I feel as if though I should have received some better treatment. Especially since this is a know problem (I know someone else who\'s N8 has completely died on them) and Nokia has refused to address it I should have received better treatment. As for the phone itself, it is hardly worth the money. The operating system is slow, with many glitches and errors that are annoying and would be simple to fix. The camera is nothing special (the biggest reason to get the phone) at night. Night pictures look like pictures taken with any old cell phone. My friend with an Android gets better night shots than my N8. This phone is completely uncompatable with Macs except for the use of iSync (thank you Apple) which just adds to my frustration. The apps are no where near what is available for iPhones or Androids. Overall, this phone is not worth the money at all. I\'m pissed that I have to stick it out with it and that I dropped that much money but I have learned my lesson.. Nokia, Never. Again.'),(257,'B003ZX7RL4','I have three of these phones and they are a pain!  All of them reboot at the slightest provocation, or with no provocation - which ever suits them best.  Maps, the GPS portion of the phone, is mostly useless.  Click on this section and the phone dies, so do not buy it for guidance.  Phone works fairly well.  I think volume is lower than it should be, but mostly I can hear my callers.  Web browsing sucks!  I installed Opera for mobiles and every search brings forth a warning of memory shortage and a request to shut down the only program I am running.  Locked screens are a nuisance!  I get lots of \"do this sort of reboot\", or \"re-flash this\", or \"try this\" from advisers.  Truth is, this is a poor phone running poor software and even poorer firmware.  The phone could be a winner, but it won\'t be.  By the time they debug this phone, Nokia will be selling something else new and wonderful.  They are no doubt on the verge right now and probably do not care about this phone and its users.  There are too many better phones out there to put up with a phone that works some of the time.  OH, the camera isn\'t bad at all.'),(258,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought the Nokia N8 when it was first released for online purchase back in October.  Since then I\'ve been using this phone ever since.Pros:- The sleek design and big screen draws a lot of attention.- The camera boasts 12mp with xenon flash- Simplistic use with one home button on the side- HDMI connectivity (which I haven\'t really found a use for yet)Cons: Despite this phone looking great and having a few extra functions that many other phones do not have, this phone is absolutely horrible when it comes to usage and practicality.- The OS, Symbian^3, is horrible and very unresponsive at times.- The gyroscope is incredibly slow. While turning the phone from portrait to landscape view you have to wait at least 1.5 seconds for it to respond.  Competitive phones like the iPhone and androids are much more responsive.- While using the HDMI to use the phone on a bigger T.V./monitor the resolution is just horrible.- Design for the phone is ugly and barely customizable.  Honestly, I don\'t know why they did this.  The actual phone looks good before you touch it.  The system is slow and looks really choppy.- While texting or doing other things the phone may switch to other applications/screensOverview:  This phone has great aesthetics, however it lacks functionality and practicality.  The OS is slow and very unresponsive at times.  The RAM in the phone is barely enough to do what you really want to do on the phone (stream videos).  The internet access is a piece of crap.  Overall, I give this phone a 2/5 stars.  It\'s good for making phone calls and taking pictures, but the extra functions need working on.'),(259,'B003ZX7RL4','Bought this handset after much deliberation; nearly 3 months of comparison with competing android and windows 7 handsets. Owned a Nokia E63 before which was a great phone to begin with. Especially when you consider that I didnt want to be bound to AT&T; contract and still wanted to use the free wifi at home and work.Turns out my decision to buy this phone was right! The handset itself is light but very very solidly built. The touch interface feels very smooth. The buttons actually depress down when touched and this is very useful to know that the handset received your input. The phone is jam packed with features; which anybody can look up on the net. I will tell you what it means for me most.The phone has excellent connectivity. The moment you switch it on it will ask if you want to copy the contacts from your old phone via bluetooth. Did that and it probably took about a minute and half to transfer 350+ contact, my entire calendar. Email set up is easy. Settings are very intuitive to use especially more if you come from a symbian background. But i would expect anybody to understand it as easily as me since I am not a mobile technoguru or anything. The handset has three desktop like screens which you can customize with applications of your choice. Mine has my email accounts, to do lists, frequently called contacts etc and let me tell you it is a wonderful experience. The camera takes awesome pictures and videos. Sound from this set is loud and I mean loud but not tinny like other handsets. It is a pleasure to listen to.The phone can take a couple of seconds to switch from portrait to landscape modes but that does not happen frequently and definitely does not hamper the user experience. The phone comes with a headset with adapters for specific ear types; an HDMI cable; a USB cable and one more USB connector. The battery holds charge for about 1.5 days and this is after extensive usage with wifi, camera and playing around. I would expect it to hold charge later too and will update again at a later date.Overall, for anybody looking for a feature rich phone at an affordable price, you can not go wrong with the N8. Recommend it without any hesitation whatsoever.'),(260,'B003ZX7RL4','Nokia more than did this one right but since I am not a very technical person, this is just a basic review. I\'ve had the phone for about 3 weeks now and am loving it. I have to agree with many in that one of the best selling points of this phone besides the great physical build and the killer 12 megapixel camera (which takes astounding pictures)is that it is unlocked.  I switched from the 5800 Xpress Music and there is definitely a big difference but being that it is still a symbian system I haven\'t ran into anything that was too hard for me to figure out by myself, music sounds great and call quality is great as well. I added a 16gb memory card on top of what the phone comes with (16gb) so I\'m more than happy with enough memory for whatever comes my way. If you are a simple person looking for a great phone with features galore(unlocked, fm transmitter, bluetooth 3.0,Dolby surround sound, tethering, USB port...) and it gives you the freedom to do things that operator branded phones don\'t then you\'ll love this phone. I know I do! (This is an edit of a previous review)'),(261,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this on a whim after falling into the Google ecosystem a couple of years ago. The big screen Android phone seduced me with their svelte bodes and sexy black attire. After the solid functionality of my E71 and the propaganda of review writers, I succumbed. At first it was great, all the attention of constantly updating apps and the constant feed of all my Google data.Then sometimes, I remembered my first love, Symbian S60. Sturdy and uncomplicated, yet the quality was there, the smooth lines, the quick efficiency, and always there at the end of long day not being power hungry. The deceptively simple interface that allowed me to work quicker and still be entertained when I needed to unwind.More and more each month I missed only having to download an app once and have it become an integral part of my phone, instead of the needy whining of the android apps, update me update me.So when I saw this this Belle beauty calling out to me, and at a price I could justify, I relented.Ah the gorgeous  build of her body, the fast smooth exuberance of the operating system, I felt connected again in every way possible (except LTE).She responded to every touch smoothly almost too eager to take me where I wanted to go, Internet bam, mail scrolling in the widjet. She sounded loud and clear in every situation, always appropriate for the setting, her profiles at the touch of a button.Never asking where I\'d been or what I\'ve been up to, just taking care of my needs in a simple yet intelligent way.My (Symbian) Belle was back with a vengeance vieing for my affections.If you can find a newer Sybian Belle phone I highly recommend it. From what I\'ve seen this puts android to shame. If your into cool factor, or can\'t really learn to use a smartphone for anything other than Facebook stay away! If you want a true pocket business computer that let\'s you play hi-fi music, any video format and a great camera, HDMI out with Dolby Surround ...Although the N8 is great, The Pureview 808 is looking good, a little thick perhaps but.. I now know  I\'m sticking with Belle as long as I can!Nokia 808 PureView Unlocked Phone with a 41 MP Camera with Carl Zeiss Optics--U.S. Warranty (White)'),(262,'B003ZX7RL4','The N8 is a brilliant design, and should have been a great phone.  If I had received a working one, I would have given it five stars.  Like many people, however, I received a defective one.  Mine constantly reboots itself, which makes using it as a GPS device, to browse the web, to play games, etc, pretty much impossible.  This seems to be a very common problem with these phones, and I was aware of it when I decided to make the purchase.  I thought that even if I did end up with a defective one, I could just get it replaced under warranty.I\'m here to tell you that you can NOT assume that you will get your defective N8 replaced under warranty.  it took several hours on the phone with customer support representatives who didn\'t seem to have a high enough comprehension of English to understand my questions to figure out how to get around the fact that the \"Request a Repair\" function on Nokia\'s website wasn\'t working.  I finally did get the phone mailed to a repair center in a city that\'s about a two hour drive from mine.  It was gone for a week, and when I got it back, the problem was worse.  It was accompanied by a piece of paper that has a section titled \"Here\'s what we did to fix it :\" The list contains the following items, typed exactly like this:Passed Software UpdatePassed Complete Functional testPassed Complete RF TestPassed Quality InspectionTechnician Comment: verified phone has restart issueSo if this list is to be believed, they ran a bunch of diagnostic tests, which it passed, decided that my phone did indeed have the problem that I had described, and sent it back to me.  Only now the phone restarts more frequently than it did before.  I hadn\'t had it turned on for three minutes the first time it did it.  I know it\'s the same one I sent them because it had a very small scratch in the plastic end from having fallen off of a desk into an open drawer.  The only explanation I can think of is that they replaced a defective component, didn\'t think to add that to the list of things that they did to fix it, and didn\'t bother to test it to make sure that the replacement part wasn\'t also defective.  Now I\'m going to have to pay for more packing materials and go another week paying for a data plan without access to a phone that can make use of it so that I can send it to them again, without the comfort of knowing that it\'ll work when I get it back.  The bottom line is that buying this phone is a huge gamble.  You might get one that works or you might not, and if you don\'t there might not be anything that you can do about it because Nokia rewards your willingness to spend $400 on a product that they\'ve admitted there have been some manufacturing problems with with a completely incompetent customer support staff.  If losing $400 isn\'t a problem for you, this is a gamble that might be worth it since a working N8 would be awesome.  If not, steer clear.'),(263,'B003ZX7RL4','I purchased this phone as I needed an unlocked phone to take overseas, since, of course, ATT won\'t unlock an phone for use while traveling.  I received this phone, upgraded it to Belle, seemed to have everything running and then got ready for my trip.The thing that no one will tell you about this phone is that it actually operates off of a C:\\ drive, which only has 256mb of storage.  Even basic MS Exchange email usage will eat up that memory and render the phone useless.  So, I go overseas and get a local SIM.  A day later, the phone is telling me it is out of memory.  Repeatedly.  After just ONE DAY of use!!!  I did research (on my iPad) and discovered this C:\\ drive issue.  I had to go in and uninstall almost everything I could find (most of which was installed on the F:\\ drive, which has 16GB), including my work email.  This rendered the whole point of having the phone moot.It also has the SIM and extra memory slots on the side covered by a flimsy rubber cover.  So, any pressure will lead the phone to think you\'ve ejected your extra memory, leading to another ubiquitous error message.  Annoying.So, don\'t buy this phone if you need to use it for anything other than very, very basic things.  And, don\'t install Nokia Belle on it either.  Maybe it works OK with regular Symbian on it, but who knows.Do not buy!!'),(264,'B003ZX7RL4','I wanted to love this phone. It\'s expensive and pretty.  I waited anxiously for it to be released and now I\"ve had it for 3 weeks and hate it.  The touch screen is error prone, hard to type on compared to i phone, or anything with real buttons. It requires real hand-eye coordination to even place a simple phone call.  The OS is slow, so if you tap the screen it takes a \"one mississippi\" before it actually registers... sometimes tapping doesn\'t register at all, or sometimes when you press it again it jumps ahead two steps.I\'ve been a loyal Nokia person since 1995 and have always been a huge fan. This phone has a big feature set, but it\'s hard to operate and the user interface is a huge disappointment.'),(265,'B003ZX7RL4','I ordered the blue N8 from Amazon and after one week I received it in excellent condition. I heard some of the N8 phones have been made in China but my phone was made in Finland, if this is something matter. As soon as I turned on it asked me for the software and firmware updates and I updated by just pressing \"yes.\"  I have been using it about a month now and it works like a charm. The photos and HD videos I took with it are amazing! The phone conversation quality is excellent. It is made of a sturdy light aluminum material and feels very well made. All the buttons are placed well and very accessible. When you take photos or videos you either use the hard button to activate or deactivate it or you can just tap on the screen. It has a real flash (not with video though) and picture quality is stunning! N8 comes with built in 16 GB and expandable to 48 GB memory with micro SDHC card. I tried the GPS function and it worked without any problem. I also use it to go to the web sites like gmail, yahoo, facebook etc., and it works flawlessly. The first time when I visited the facebook it asked me for a facebook Nokia app. After that you just tap to FB app in applications menu and it immediately connects. Same thing with gmail. I am a long time Symbian OS user and found Symbian^3 OS to be very powerful and advanced. Yes, it needs a little bit polishing here and there but in no sense lesser than rivals IOS, Android or Microsoft Mobile 7. I was aware the fact that Nokia was in negotiations with Microsoft to use their OS on the next generations of cell phones before I ordered the N8 but it did not affect my decision. I think Nokia\'s decision is a big mistake but it is a subject of a totally different discussion. In any case, Nokia N8 is a superb phone and a gadget. I am a Mac user and it perfectly communicates and synchronizes through bluetooth connection. I have read some other users complaints here, such as \"phone is not turning on,\" \"freezes,\" \"shuts off,\" or problems with interaction with software etc. May be I\'m fortunate but none of those happened to me and Symbian^3  is a superior and very fast OS. It is a true multi-tasking device. You can leave one application open to go to another and than return. I use the N8 with my T-mobile connection and did not experience any problems either. I just took out the T-mobile sim card from my old phone and slide it into the N8. That is it! I have a very reasonably priced old t-zone data connection account with T-mobile and all web connections go through it without any problem. I also tried the wi-fi and it also works perfect. N8 has a decent built in FM radio transmitter and works very good. I covered the phone with OtterBox Impact Case for Nokia N8 . It gives it a negligible bulk but it also provides a good protection. Unfortunately it also covers my phones blue beauty:)Over all I am very happy with my Nokia N8 so far.'),(266,'B003ZX7RL4','Updated after many months of ownership.NEW REVIEWWhat I liked:- the camera is outstanding, no question.- this is a computer replacement no modification required. I connect apple Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to the phone and hook it to the my TV screen through HDMI and there I have a full computer for simple office use (e-mail, web , and games). I can hook in my hard drive to the micro USB and I can modify my files with the office apps provided.- I can talk at the same time browse the internet on 3g (that is not just and apple + at&t; as the advertisement claims);- tethering and sharing 3g connection via wifi;- a full use of the GPS capability with some free apps; Ovi MAP is outstanding- perfect sync with Gmail, google calendar and google contacts.The problems:- The HDMI cover cracked before I even used, this is apparently a common problem with N8.- ovi store and apps installation are really annoying, I cannot tell you how many time I had to re-install and update the CNN news app.- I gave up transferring my musics through ovi suite. I\'d rather just do it manually- I gave up fixing/finding the MTP driver with windows 7 64bit- I\'m annoyed that skype video does not exist for symbian.OLD REVIEWFirst off, I got it cheaper here so price/quality cannot be beaten compared to many smart phones.What I like:- Penta band 3.5 G connection: I\'m on T-mobile in the U.S.(1700 / 2100Mhz), I have to switch to European bands (1900/2100) from time to time, and my country uses 850/2100 Mhz.- The camera: With this phone\'s Carl Zeiss lens (with 12 Megapixel ccd) I don\'t need a point and shoot camera in my pocket.- USB on the go: you can plug in USB flash drives and transfer files. I attached Sandisk multi-card reader and it works...- HDMI out: one of my DVD encoded documentary was 1.7 Gb; I thought it would not play but it was smooth...perfect.- The Fm receiver/ transmitter: I bought the car charger (Nokia D4) just for this. Now I play my music through fm radio transmitter.- The music player is a little \"wanna be\" apple\'s cover flow but it\'s good.- OVI map and voice guidance is excellent. I would rank it higher than Tom Tom\'s services besides it is free and does not require data coverage.- Full Office set: quickoffice, file manager, pdf reader, even a zip manager for free.- I can download any file, and send them as e-mail attachments- True multitasking, no question! (OVI map on + music on + transmitting through fm radio + wifi tethering)Some critics:- I think Symbian^3 interfaces are smooth, way better than the previous S60 but can be improved a lot. It is NOT snappy feel like iOS but good enough.- Symbian has less support and that is Nokia\'s responsibility especially now that they are moving away from its openness. On top of that windows mobile will be the next platform.- Voice command is not that good...web browser sucks, although there are some good implementation in app forms (eg \"AP news\" or \"Accuweather\")- Symbian OS takes a learning curve. If you expect something that just works and easy...you will be frustrated.- Switching between wifi and 3G connection and automatic turn on and off are sometimes problematic.My recommendation:Use Opera mobile instead of the nokia\'s web browserAPPS: Install internet radio, big screen for HDMI, Joikuspot for a 3g to WiFi tethering, swipe to improve on screen keyboard.Make sure there is not app that keeps your 3g connection on. Not only you have to pay the bill but it drains you battery really fast. When pairing with windows 7, make sure it does not automatically connect and backup, I experienced many crashes.If you use windows 7 64bit to pair with the N8\'s Bluetooth, I recommend you search on google \" ASUS Bluetooth driver\" and install it. That would activate many options including (1) use of your pc\'s speaker/micro phone as your headset (2) sim access or a direct call from your computer (3)...Last words: The hardware can handle all highly graphic demanding mobile 3d games (Need for speed, Real golf 2011,Galaxy on fire pre-installed) but I wonder what a superfast processor and high memory would improve. Looking forward to update to Symbian Anna in September.'),(267,'B003ZX7RL4','*The 12MP camera is amazing (as you would expect) with the Xenon flash, takes great photos and Full HD videos.*The OS is the new version of Symbian, which is more customizable with multiple home screens and many improvements to the previous OSs.*The OVI Store now has Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja and many other more popular games.*The multi-tasking experience is now much better.*The phone does not feel cheap.*The phone has a built in photo and video editor.*The touch screen is effective and responsive.-The OVI Store is very limited.-The speakers are not too loud, but works well.'),(268,'B003ZX7RL4','I should have written this review earlier, I bought this phone in September of 2011. The camera is amazing and takes fantastic pictures. What sets it apart from all, other camera phones is the Zennon Flash. Interior pictures requiring flah look amazing. If I am out with friends at a social gathering and we want to take few pictures they always want to use my camera. They all have iPhones 4s, 5\'s and Samsung galaxies. These other phones can not compare to the picture taking quality of Nokia N8. Below are my pro\'s and con\'s:Cons:- doesn\'t use android so there are not a lot of apps, games etcPros:- super amazing picture taking quality- Zennon flash revealing true colors not that blue LED color of all other smart phone pictures- tight tight sealed package, I dropped this phone into a sink full of water it sat submerged for 30 seconds it worked fine when retrieved no damage at all- battary charges incredibly fast using nokia charging port vs mini USB port charges 100% in 30 minutes- full office type software; word, excel, ppt- huge standard memory- FM RF transmitter can play music directly to any radio, use it all the time when on trips using rental cars- map software GPS doesn\'t require data connect, when traveling abroad I don\'t have to worry about data charges- wifi hot spot is amazing, it works well with Joikuspot, my cell service requires wifi tethering charges but this phone being unlocked gets around this. As long as whatever computer, ipad etc your using to access the web through the wifi hotspot appears to be mobile device your provider will not block it.- Has DLNA capability I can share videos and pictures wirelessly on my home network with one touch- essential applications are available for sharing amazing pictures and videos, Dropbox, Facebook, twitter etc...'),(269,'B003ZX7RL4','Nokia N8 is a great phone for I\'ve had one in the past and was bought here on Amazon but from a different seller. Nokia Sealed box, everything 100% OK.Just bought 2 Nokia\'s N8 from Omnitel believing their Nokia\'s N8 were also as previous i had bought through other seller, but came to find out that they were not, as the boxes weren\'t nokia sealed, missing HDMI cables, damaged USB cable, camera doesn\'t work on one of them. After these issues seller hasn\'t helped in anyway to solve problems. Went to Nokia care center only to find out that these phones sold by Omnitel are CHINESE and therefore no waranty on them as Omnitel claims they have as they claim also that they are US versions which aren\'t. Hope that Amazon can help me with this issue.'),(270,'B003ZX7RL4','I bought this phone from Amazon, a week back and I own a Nokia N900 too.  I wish to compare these two, as Nokia N900 is one of the greatest phones from Nokia.1)  First let me go to internet browsing.Nokia N900 is the first phone to have full flash player and the major capability is it will play videos directly in the browser, for sites like youtube, facebook etc.  Once facebook moved to latest flash player, N900 is not able to play the videos(eventhough there is a hack).Nokia N8, does not have full flash player, but it has flash lite.  I was expecting that the youtube and facebook will not be able to play the videos directly in the browser.  To my surprise, both the sites played the video in the site itself, thats really great.With respect to Nokia N900, every site determines it as a computer and hence will show the full page, instead of the mobile site, which is good, if the wifi or 3G is really good.With respect to Nokia N8, every site determines it as a mobile and hence will first display the mobile site, but if you re-route it to the full site, still it displays the sites like charm.Conclusion: with respect to internet browsing Nokia N8 does great.2)  Playing videos.Nokia N900 has a resolution of 800x480, hence the videos look very good.Nokia N8 has a resolution of 640x360, so I expected videos(good videos like HD videos) will look less attractive, but to my surprise, it looks great in Nokia N8.Nokia N900 can almost play any video format directly, like wmv, avi etc, including flv.  I am not sure whether any other phone can do/compete with this.Nokia N8 on the other hand, has the ability to play any video format, but for avi and flv there is a little trick.  When you copy an avi file, your PC may complain that this device is not capable to play it, but you can still use it as a storage and say yes to it.  To my surprise, media player picks and plays well.  For .flv files, after you copy, the media player is not going to pick it, as if it doesn\'t support it.  If you go to file manager and click on this .flv file, media player picks it and plays well.  I haven\'t tried .mkv file yet, as the mkv files that I have are all big and it is not allowing me to copy those.Conclusion: Playing videos is very good in Nokia N8.3)  Camera.Nokia N900 has 5MP camera and in this area, Nokia N8 stays way ahead with 12MP camera and xenon flash.Nokia N8 has xenon flash, which normal cameras use, still even normal cameras cannot take good pictures in dim night lighting.  Similarly N8 photos come good, if taken in close shots in night.  In daylight, photos come really good.  The beauty with N8 is its photo and video editing softwares out of the box, which are really good.HD video recording in N8 is good, provided you don\'t show quick movements to turn the camera to a different angle and this is mainly due to the 25 frames per second video recording.Conclusion: Nokia N8 camera and its capabilities are one of the best.4)  GPS.Nokia N900 is pretty dumb in this area too, as it doesn\'t have voice guidance out of box.  So lets directly jump to Nokia N8.Nokia N8 has one of the best GPS with voice guidance, one major disadvantage that I came across is, it needs 3G connection to work(I am not sure whether this is correct, what I am quoting is just my experience).  Once it connects, it works good.  I just found two minor issues, one is it informs you to take a turn just when you are few feet away to take the turn, whereas Garmin GPS informs you well ahead.  Similar way when you arrive at your destination, it says you arrived at destination, it does not say, whether your destination is on the right or left, whereas Garmin GPS tells which side your destination is going to be.Conclusion: Nokia N8 GPS is definitely good.5)  Widgets.Nokia N900 stands out with respect to widgets and its definitely the best in the industry.  You can place the widgets whereever you want, even one on top of the other.  Widgets are really useful in N900.Nokia N8 on the other hand has fixed dimensions for widgets and you can\'t place it whereever you like.  You need to place it in the designated places.  The main drawback for this that I found is, in email widget, you don\'t get much required information from the widget, you still need to jump into the mail app to know what email came to you now.  Still widgets look good in N8.Conclusion: Nokia N8 widgets are still good.6)  Chat and Voip.Nokia N900 stands out in this area too, as Skype worked with Nokia to have the skype integrated into the contacts.  Like that, google, yahoo, even sametime all are integrated into the contacts itself.  You just need to go to contacts to see who is online.  You can call that contact through various options, like gsm call or voip call using skype or skype to skype call or skype to skype video call, same way for google, yahoo etc.  It is very powerful, none of the mobile has it integrated like this.With respect to Nokia N8, I believe it is not out of box and I am not sure whether I need to install anything to get a similar experience.  I heard skype is still building an app for N8, so still I am searching for a provider who can offer video calling capabilities, so that I can use the secondary camera.Conclusion: Nokia N8\'s capabilities in this area are not yet explored.7)  Social networks.Nokia N900 has beautiful widgets and integration to contact well.Nokia N8 is not less to this.  It has widgets and integration to contact also well.Conclusion: Nokia N8\'s social network capabilities are good.8)  Bluetooth.Nokia N900 has the usual bluetooth version and it works good even with A2DP.Nokia N8 stands out in this, with latest bluetooth version 3.0.  The transfers are really fast compared to the older version.  The beauty comes with out of box drivers to support bluetooth devices like mouse, keyboard etc.  Imagine, I paired my bluetooth keyboard and mouse to the phone and it reduced the time that I spent to do the typing, a lot.  I don\'t have a monitor to connect using the HDMI port, if I have, then it becomes a complete system.Conclusion: This is one of the best in Nokia N8.9)  Battery life.Nokia N900, in line with all the other powerful smartphones, with all the widgets constantly checking the internet and all the chat softwares too constantly checking internet, it comes for 75% of the day and you need to charge it after that.Nokia N8, to my surprise even with all the above said things, it is able to withstand for atleast 2 days.Conclusion: Battery is really good in N8.10)  WebTV.Nokia N900 doesn\'t have this capability.Nokia N8: need to explore in this area.Conclusion: Need to explore in this area.11)  Micro USB capabilities.Nokia N900, not much to say.Nokia N8, can read your memory stick out of the box and will show it as a drive in the file manager.Conclusion: Micro USB in Nokia N8 is capable of more things.12)  Speakers.Nokia N900, has stereo speakers and it can produce loud sounds without any external speakers.Nokia N8, doesn\'t have stereo speakers, but to my surprise the sound is equally loud as N900, but I found only one problem in this area, as the speaker is in the camera compartment which directly comes in contact to the ground.  If you keep the phone down on a desk, you will not be able to hear any sound, as the speaker is blocked by the desk.  Similarly even the mic is on the same side, so if you talk over phone handsfree, by keeping the phone on the desk, both the parties are not going to hear properly.13)  FM transmitter and internet radio.Nokia N900 is outstanding in this area.  If you find to get your popular radio stations URL from internet, you just need to grab the URL and give it to the media player, then N900 can stream your radio station live from internet either using wifi or 3G, which means even if you are in any part of the world, you will be able to hear your favourite radio station live.  Using the build-in FM transmitter, you can transmit to your own car radio.Nokia N8 has the FM transmitter, which is equally good to N900.  Even though N8 has internet radio concept, it is basically app based, which means whatever stations the app is providing, thats what you are going to hear.  If you want to do the same things as above(like grabbing an url and feeding it to media player), I am not sure how to do it.Conclusion: FM transmitter is really good, but internet radio needs some improvement.I hope, I covered the review of some distinct features apart from the usual ones.'),(271,'B003ZX7RL4','Bought phone to replace N97 which is giving me RAM memory problems.

This product general built is also very good quality, better than the crappies blackberries, huawei and motorolla, it does is. Camera quality it\'s the best of the best, very very clear pictures, but no so good in rooms with poor ligth. Adding memory you will have lot of space to record pics and videos. Some cons are the battery, it doesnt long more than 1 day, it\'s annoying having to charge it almost every day, it seems consuming too much power and doesnt like or know how to save it, software and functions get choppy when battery is dying. Software is too complex and confusing, i really hate this part, even considering switch to a less &#34;advanced&#34; phone with a simple software like Nokia E72 wich i owned, Applications and functions depend on internet speed, mine is very bad and slow so i can\'t take advantage of this, except to watch my Email\'s accounts, sending sms it\'s easy for the dictionary and size of the virtual keyboard, but responsiveness of screen vary acording to power stock, which is always dying whenever i need the phone, lol. Graphical power is good, games play as old NES and Music Videos look really really amazing, terrific colours, sound it\'s loud but mediocre. Web browsing is fast for me as much as i use the wifi.As corollary, regardin to battery life i think buying a brand new battery should fix the issue, and about connectivity well, i cant blame the cellular since my Telecomunications provider is the real guitly for its bad and unestable service.

There are vertical and horizantal lines on the screen. the lines are very noticeable when I hold my phone horizantally (landscape mode).I did not waste my time trying to fix it and just opened my amazon account and requested replacement.Within 1 hour I got e-mail from customer representative telling me that they were sorry for the problem and they already placed an order for new phone and estimated delivery is up coming wednesday.I will receive new one at free of charge of course and no return shipment cost since they sent me UPS postage label as well.Phone is very nice, you can get anything you want. It is very easy to use.I used iphone4 little bit and honestly there is no big difference with this one and iphone.I will write more detailed review once I get my new one but so far I am glad to make this purchaseSo overall, phone is worth to pay 400 bucks as long as you buy it from amazon. Because there is a possibility that you may get a defective one.So dont waste your time if you think something is wrong with your phone and just return it.I am happy with my purchase thru amazon, excellent customer service.Thanks amazon.'),(275,'B003ZX7RL4','Update:After using this phone for about 6 months, I have to say that this is one beautiful phone. I\'ve used the GPS for a trip down the East coast with great results. Call quality has been great where ever I\'ve been and with the recent Belle upgrade to the Symbian OS, the N8 should be considered as an alternative to any phone out there. The free(no data plan required) GPS, great battery life and high quality camera are just head and shoulders above even the newest models offered by other manufacturers. I see that prices have not come down since I bought my phone and that has to be because of the demand for this phone. The quality is outstanding. I don\'t think you will ever regret buying the N8.First and foremost, you are buying a cell phone that gets excellent reception and sounds good on both ends of the call. That\'s why you buy a phone. Why this phone stood out to me is the extras you get. And since I don\'t consider a tad over 400 gold grinkles cheap, those extras better make it worth while. They did to me.1. You don\'t need a point and shoot. The camera on this phone is the best ever used on a cell phone. What you will be doing without is the telephoto capabilities, but the camera takes great pictures and is easy to use.2. You don\'t need a dedicated mp3 player and video player. The music player is very good.  You won\'t be giving up anything. Sound and video qualities are excellent.3. You don\'t need dedicated GPS unit. OVI maps are great. They come free with lifetime updates and give you spoken turn by turn directions with street names. You do not need a data plan for OVI maps to work like you do with other phone mapping programs. The screen is not as large as some of the other cell phones or GPS units out there but it is very legible never the less.4. The web browser stinks but Opera Mini takes care of that.5. It also comes with a dictionary that can work as a translator if you download (for free) other languages (up to 2 more) at the OVI store. Going to Madrid and Paris this year? Download Spanish and French. Going to Berlin next year? Dump one of the others and download German.6. You\'ll have to do your own research on the social stuff. I\'m not into Twitter or Face Book.7. Battery life is outstanding. I used the GPS without a car charger for over an hour and the battery only went down one bar. That may be about 15% of the battery life but I\'m not sure if the battery indicator is linear. Using the phone for calls and texts and a couple hours a day on the internet with wifi and it still goes a couple of days between charges. That would never happen with my Droid X.What\'s not so good about this phone is Symbian. Besides the Droid X, I own and old iPod Touch. Using either one of those operating systems is childs play compared to Symbian. It is not intuitive at all. Options are hidden inside other options in menus that make no sense.I am willing to put up with that because of everything else that sets this phone apart from other smart phones.Plus, being unlocked there\'s no contract and it will work anywhere in the world. It also comes with a good amount of memory and you get a couple of cables that would cost you a lot of money if you had to buy them separately.So add it all up and be conservative. It\'s a $100 point and shoot camera. It\'s a $100 video & mp3 player. It\'s a $100 GPS unit. It\'s a $100 phone. It\'s all these things in one and it costs about the same as buying them all separately.'),(276,'B004TS2GJC','PROS-This phone is what you want if you use a PHONE.I tried MANY phones -from- AT&T; (and returned all of them) wanting a phone I could use for phone calls.  ALL of them -would not- allow me to call my WIRED TELEPHONE ANSWERER and pick up messages.  These were called SMART PHONES but they -would not- allow me to punch in a code for the answerer in order to retrieve my messages.The SMART PHONES just would not allow me to enter the numbers and pick up messages.  I\'m no dummy and tried every way I could to retrieve messages.  It seems they block key entry when calling.This phone has a KEYPAD -and- a TOUCH SCREEN.  You can use EITHER, so you are not -locked out- from pushing numbers after calling, yet you can use the TOUCH SCREEN to do other things.The phone is VERY intuitive and allows you to do SMART PHONE things if you want.The battery life is good, similar to my old Motorola.The 5 mb camera/video is good but not excellent for a cell phone.CONS-The USB port -charging- is funky. The TOP indicator (on the phone) indicates you are CHARGING when connected but you may NOT be unless your PC -recognizes- your phone.  So you have a CHARGE indicated on the TOP indicator but the phone POPS UP a message saying PHONE NOT FULLY CHARGED, kind of weird.The Nokia PC software like Nokia PC Suite or OVI Suite are IMHO pretty much useless.  They don\'t seem to work with this phone and get DRIVER ERRORS when I installed them.  I contacted Nokia with no help.The plus side is you can connect the phone to W7 and MANUALLY transfer most things.  I\'m not sure how this will work with my CONTACTS -if- I ever want to RESTORE them to a phone.  The Motorola allowed me to do this very simply.  I could keep a backup on my PC with little effort.Except for the CONTACTS BACKUP - this is a great phone.'),(277,'B004TS2GJC','I have always been a NOKIA fan for its long lfe batteries, strong & sturdy encasements and  signal reception. This time I was making a maiden purchase of a Unlocked phone in US.Over a year I have seen innumerable Smart Phones of different makes & of different statements for individuals but I wondered how many of us actually need a Smart Phone.Do you need to browse google map while driving on a FreeWay??..In 24 hrs we are connected to internet for 18 hrs either thru laptops,desktops,tablets OR ubiquitious phones. Hence, I thought..lets give it a break.I needed a phone which was presentable, strong & capable to many activitied at the same time not provocative to my restless fingers. Lot of brands offer multiple phones..at range of $110-$200 & they are all basically entery level advanced phones..after evaluating all others for their look, style, comaptibility & speed NOKIA was again undisputable choiceX3-02 is Sleek, Slim, Super Battery life, Awesome Display & Camera...& Quite sufficient for those who do not need data plans( OR Free Way plans :) ) but are happy with Wi-Fi at hotspots/home..This phone is For you..You can watch Youtubes,work on Facebooks & likes..( although display might not be comparable to iPhone)Do not compare to Smart phones of Apple,Samsung or > $200 range..if you like superfast,high resolution GUI & Apps go for iPhone..This Phone is not for you'),(278,'B004TS2GJC','product was just as described.  as for the seller, shipping was quick. i paid, and i received.  some reviews said this phone got funky at times.  I\'ve had this for about a month, and it was a huge upgrade from the Samsung Evergreen, which liked to restart itself when I received a text, or sometimes by itself for no reason at all.  It also shut itself off sometimes whenever I received an incoming call.  i haven\'t had any problems with the touchscreen, which other reviewers have remarked.  the phone itself is a very light slim candy bar phone, easy to carry.'),(279,'B004TS2GJC','The X3-02 is a good entry level smartphone, the touch screen interface is good as the calls reception, good battery life, materials an construction feels solid and durable, it\'s better to add a silicon protector to grab the phone securedly, because the metal back feels slippery, the phone do not come with micro usb cable to connect to a computer, you have to buy a separete cable, I dont know why Nokia do this, only few models comes with the usb cables, this must be a standart feature included in the box, this is my 4th Nokia phone, I\'ll recommend for people who want an entry level smatphone. Works perfetly with cellphone carriers in my country (GSM, Movilnet).'),(280,'B004TS2GJC','It is incredible that Nokia has come up with a super sleek phone with almost all the feature you would look for in a smart phone. Look and feel of the phone make this phone a huge bargain for the price of the phone.But, what it lacks IMHO is a decent camera experience. It lacks the camera focus feature that one finds in almost any decent phone and so, taking a sharp pic is ruled out. 5MP camera without focus feature is counter intuitive. It also doesn\'t have a front facing camera but oh well, can\'t have everything in a phone that comes at a good bargain.Pros: Sleekness, Design, Price for featues: 3G, WiFiCons: CameraIn the end, I didn\'t care much about the camera as it serves as a great gift for your loved ones.'),(281,'B004TS2GJC','I have been a long time Nokia user but have been turned off by their latest models but this one made up for it. The Nokia X3-02 is perfect for those who are still avoiding the Smartphone / PDA / Blackberry / iPhone / Android craze (VIVA LE REVOLUCION). It has a nice little touch screen that comes with a full touch QWERTY keypad. You can use a stylus (not included) with it which I recommend since the screen is smaller than other touch screens. The resolution is great and sound is near perfect. The Bluetooth functionality is a little spotty, it disconnects from my car\'s bluetooth link up randomly but works perfectly on my Jawbone bluetooth earpiece. Configuring the SMS and Web functionality was a bit confusing but the WiFi function makes up for that. You can be within an open WiFi singal and connect without having to go through your Network provider which is a major plus.'),(282,'B004TS2GJC','I am a big time nokia fan. Since past 18 years I have used Nokia phones but was never so disappointed. This phone is really a trash. Touch screen does not work well. Unfortunately, the keypad doesn\'t have any key to support touch screen functions in case the touch screen goes bad. Speakerphone sucks it is better to not having it.My landline\'s regular phone volume is better than this phone\'s speaker phone.  Volume is very low. Scrolling on touch screen is horrible. And Internet, you can not use it on this phone with it\'s touch screen features.I would say if you just want a phone Nokia X2 is way better than this trashy phone. Do not buy this phone. You will regret it.'),(283,'B004TS2GJC','You cannot update the firmware for this phone.  I\'ve tried contacting tech support, level 2 tech support, etc. and have had no luck. The Nokia support site says you can update this in the US.  Do not trust it.  You cannot update it via phone update or nokia pc suite or nokia software updater.The phone otherwise is a piece of beautiful machinery: elegant looking, loud, and great great receptions.  The home screen is customizable and the loud speaker sounds great.  The music player software is awful, though.  It\'s simple to use, but it needs some major update.Anyhow, a traveling global phone, it\'s awesome.  It fits in your wallet if you need it to.'),(284,'B004TS2GJC','Like many others, I have been a long time fan of Nokia phones, they are not always the most high end of phones like the current Iphone or androids but I myself dont really need to carry around a $400 dual-core processor android phone all day. That\'s what my laptop is for! I have gone through many phones with T-mobile and the prices of phones just get more expensive and they are just cheesy phones, In my opinion. When I first saw this phone I knew it was love at first sight. Something about the simplicity of the candy bar style design of nokia phones just intrigues me, especially with the design of this new x3 touch and type. Its refreshingly new and sleek. and almost as slim as my 4g Ipod touch which makes it easy to carry around in your pocket with no hassle. not like all those other heavy touch screen phones that mimic the Iphone. Its almost weightless, yet heavy enough to remind you of the quality. The quality of the touch screen is not high definition by any means, but very good considering it\'s a Nokia. Being able to text with the keypad and use the touch screen to navigate through menus and settings and such is a perfect combination on this phone. You really have to hold it in your hand to experience it. And its a nokia so the battery life is awesome of course. I read a few bad reviews on this phone before I bought it, but if your looking for a simple yet smart little phone that is very easy to use and reliable then this nokia is the phone for you! Anyone who likes the touchscreen feature but doesnt need all those apps and useless programs on the newer phones this is your phone!!!'),(285,'B004TS2GJC','As someone who is online with a laptop or tablet most hours of the day I\'ve avoided the expense and recharging hassles of smartphones.I use my X3-02 with the T-Mobile Pay as You Go service in the States. This was an upgrade from a candybar style 5130c XpressMusic which served me well for basic voice service, SMS, and a music player. Battery life was ~7 days with light service. I travel internationally 3-4 times a year and so wanted a phone to accept the regional carrier sim cards or ideally the ability to make VoIP calls.Here\'s a breakdown of the X3 features.Fit and finish: *****Compact and well built. Metallic case and nice size buttons.Documentation: ***Printed manual with package was in German but found the English edition easy enough online.Battery life: ***When the WiFi automatic WAN connection option is enabled battery life is less than 2 days. With WiFi and BT disabled ~5 days. My charging routine is to use the USB cable to re-synch calendar and contacts with my office laptop. This also recharges the phone.Voice/SMS: *****Works as expected. Like the threaded-discussion style presentation of messages.VoIP/IM: **I have not been able to make internet calls yet with the phone. I may have a home firewall issue. I\'ve tried ippi and FriendCaller service providers without success. IM via WhatsApp did work for me between Japan and the States. This was a nice upgrade over the old 5130. VoIP is something I continue to troubleshoot. Other mainstream/popular apps for VoIP from Skype or Vonage are focused on the iOS and Android markets and so do not currently offer Symbian support.Camera: ****Big upgrade for me to go from the 2 Megapixel 5130 to a 5 Megapixel X3.Media player: ****Works. Nice short cut controls and volume rocker on the side of the phone.Personalization: *****I like to customize my interface and the X3 provides lots of theme and screen organization options so you can put your preferred tools at the level and order you prefer.Apps: ***The practical app selection is low for the X3 and the bulk on the Nokia OVI store depends on the Nokia Xpress Web Browser to run instead of standalone Java apps. Many apps appear to be cheap excuses to display banner ads. Most of the city guides are oriented to metro areas of India. I could not find a good map application and without GPS or cell tower triangulation apps with geo-location will not work. I did fine a few helpful apps that certainly raise the value this phone over the most basic voice/SMS: WhatsApp for IM, e-mail (Yahoo and POP), Weather Channel, Opera browser. The Xpress web browser is a bit awkward and does not handle website redirect pages very well. Not sure if it\'s Javascript handling or what the root cause it. I find myself having to do lots of page refreshing to get pages to load completely. I like to use the Panera cafes in my area for long lunch / work sessions and the log-in and redirect process to get online causes pages to freeze under Xpress. I believe Xpress must be used as part of the WAN connection process (instead of Opera or UC Browser alternatives).'),(286,'B007MPZT2K','This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3. It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g  supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it\'s hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard.  The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to \'normal\' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The \'function\' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited.'),(287,'B007MPZT2K','This phone, like all of Nokia\'s feature phones, are great for their value and durability.  The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone.  It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn\'t accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P  This phone is basically an update of the C-3.  It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing.  This is the best phone you can get if you\'re looking for functionality, but don\'t want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone.  If you\'re looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed.  If you\'re looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed.  Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it\'s not good for recreational browsing.  I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that.  It also has some social network apps, but I don\'t use them.  I don\'t know how well they work, but if that\'s a priority for you this phone probably isn\'t the best choice.  Same goes for the camera; I don\'t use it, can\'t speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn\'t the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small.  I haven\'t had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to.  If you\'re looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.'),(288,'B007MPZT2K','First off, let me say I\'ve been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I\'ve always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I\'ve been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn\'t get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won\'t get into video games and SNS because I don\'t even do that on my PC so I don\'t have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it\'s a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don\'t want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found aGino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plugto use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I\'m really enjoying the phone for when I\'m sitting outside with friends or at my desk.'),(289,'B007MPZT2K','I have enjoyed my Nokia C3 phone for a few years, but it was tired and needed an update.  This Asha 302 phone is just that - all of the Symbian S40 simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware.  The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional. The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile\'s 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan.  Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all.  Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting.  Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some.  I may get myself another one or two for the future, as I bet this is the end-run for this type of practical phone.'),(290,'B007MPZT2K','My best friend bought this phone and loves it.Does this phone include the micro memory card in the purchase when you buy it from Amazon?Which SIM card would be best for this unlocked phone?

I like it because it is easy and will have wifi  and Internet all the time.  That is my understanding since it is not recognized as a smart phone and does not need to access AT&T; data so I do not have to pay for that monthly charge.If anybody has updates, I\'d love to hear.  Everyone wants the smart phones, but I think for the value and having Internet is a big deal and a decent camera all for under $140.00 is fantastic.Has anybody imported contacts on the Nokia Asha 302?

After going through about 3 of them, this fits the bill very well. The texting interface is very nice and intuitive. The battery life is stellar. It connects to the internet just fine. I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc. Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles. Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too. The OS seems very stable and snappy. You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc.Backup is a snap. Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up. No more iTunes! If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you\'re done.I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it.'),(292,'B007XL8FUG','The phone arrived promptly.  Basically for the kind of basic phone that it is, I love it.  A couple of small problems....speaker phoneloudest volume is not very loud and when navigating menu it first off goes to the web and turns it on quickly .  For that reason I have the web browser service turned off as before I would get charged each and every time regardless if I used it or not. You can call AT&T; and they will reimburse for the turn on\'s, but that is extra work.  If I had unlimited web on my service than it wouldn\'t be a worry.Otherwise phone is sturdy and easy to use and  works well for my needs.'),(293,'B007XL8FUG','Our home location has marginal cell phone coverage from all carriers. However, for 10 years I carried a Nokia for business as it was the only phone I tried that works in the home.When it finally broke I tried an Apple smart phone. It was not as good as the Nokia\'s reception, but it did work marginally in the home. I got the iphone wet and had to trash it.I replaced it with a Samsung Rugby 3 that I liked better than any other I tried. However,  it would not reliably pick up a signal in the home and calls would go to voice mail without ringing the phone.That is when I made the decision to go back to a brand that had the reputation for a good signal in marginal coverage areas. The Nokia 6350 shows 3-4 bars in the home whereas the others I tried had 1-2 bars in the same exact location.The phone does everything I need it to do for a fraction of the cost of a smart phone.The only downside is the back cover doesn\'t fit snugly and the cover will slide off accidentally and expose the battery. I will try to find a new cover or else put a strip of tape around around the edges. I don\'t figure there will be many times I need to get into the battery or sd card area.'),(294,'B007XL8FUG','I purchased the same phone 2-3 years ago and really liked it.

I do occasionally text (1-2/month) and it is easier on a keyboard style phone but I have an Apple iPhone and iPad when I need to do any serious typing of text.I use the bluetooth connection when driving and sound, volume and battery life are all good.This also works great as a music player and the camera is not bad.Overall, the battery life is great and the sound quality is as good as any other Nokia phone.'),(295,'B007XL8FUG','Outdated, true but it\'s solid.Pro\'s. Good battery life. Seems to be good quality. Good volume. Good reception and clear sound.Cons. The push to talk button is a pain in the $%#. You will hit it more than a few times. A real pain having to tell it to cancel all the time. You have to back out every level of the menu structure. Can\'t just close the phone and return to the main level. Don\'t expectto get any satisfaction from the pictures. Very limited ring tone selection. It does have Bluetooth. You may be able to transfer a ringtone via bluetooth though I could not get a link established. Only tried for 10 or so minutes then gave up. Using Win8 so someone using Win7 or below may be able to do so.Sum. A good solid outdated basic phone.

Unfortunately, I have to give it a lower score than that because of the deceptive marketing on this item.  The phone I received was not unlocked, and on closer inspection has AT&T branding.  I bought it from DailyCelluar, and I believe that they intentionally lied to me to scam me out of additional money.  I would leave this negative review with them, except that too much time has elapsed for me to do that.'),(298,'B00836Y6B2','Just received my phone yesterday...and I love it!! It arrived on time which is a plus and was fully charged. Slipped in an AT&T micro sim and I\'m up and running with no problems. For anyone wanting this phone it\'s best to check out Youtube first for a full reviews on the phone before buying. I also clicked on the seller\'s reviews as well to see what I might expect, and I had no problems with them either. I was skeptical at first to purchase this phone due to the bad reviews. But after taking the time to actually sit and watch the reviews I knew what I was getting before it got here. Even still I didn\'t expect this phone to be as nice as it is. I got home last night and it was in my box and I haven\'t been able to put it down yet!!! The only thing I didn\'t like though was having to use Zune for my music player, not a deal breaker though. Love how Facebook is integrated, I really don\'t have to download the app to access it. All in all this has been a great experience purchasing my first unlocked phone!!!'),(299,'B00836Y6B2','First of all the Windows 7 OS sucks and third party apps aren\'t as plentiful as on other phone.  Second, today after a year of use, the phone has decided to crap out on me.  Third party apps will no longer start and it will no longer pair to my Bluetooth devices.  This essentially makes the phone useless on my data plan and really only for emergency uses only now since I can\'t talk using my headset.  And then the whole Zune thing, good grief.  I\'m not buying any more Microsoft related products again if I can help it - no Xbox, no Windows phone, etc...'),(300,'B00836Y6B2','OK, so I own the Lumia 900 and have since the May release date.  While it is a stylish phone of good build quality, you cannot judge a book by it\'s cover - which is the only place where the quality of this phone shines.  It\'s pretty, but.....So, Microsoft made a phone that is already obsolete, cannot use ANY instant messaging applications or multitask properly, and has numerous flaws that are just add up to a frustrating experience.  Not to mention that suppliers and third party companies are avoiding the Windows phone platform almost entirely.  Go to the electronics store and try comparing how many accessories you can find for all the other phones with what you can find for the Lumia 900 - it\'s beyond sad.  And the software!!  I had a Blackberry that ran the mobile MS Office applications with better functionality and feature-set than the MS hardware, MS software combination of the Lumia.  And MS owns Skype but wait, wait... nope, it doesn\'t work on the Lumia. (unless you disable your screen from timing out {dead battery} and keep Skype as the running app on the screen {switch to another app and Skype logs out}) Running one app works fine, but how smart is it to install an instant messaging application on a phone that cannot run instant messaging while you\'re doing something like, let\'s say, looking at the home screen of the phone to see what time it is.  Pathetic.I\'m a sucker who used to have faith in Microsoft products, so I gave this phone a chance and believed all the fan-boy hyped reviews.  Repeat - I am the sucker.  Please, don\'t join the crowd of disappointed people who are now wondering if they can find anyone stupid enough to buy a used Lumia off of them so that they can escape to the capable platform of Android or, dare I say it, Apple (and I hate Apple).  If you love a pretty box and don\'t care about functionality - go for it, but if you actually want a capable smart-phone please save yourself before it\'s too late and forget this phone ever existed (like MS already did).'),(301,'B00836Y6B2','Arrived exactly as described - Inserted SIM - powered it up, instant service! I love the Windows OS 7.5 - the user interface could not be more simple, attractive and intuitive! Skype app (downloaded from windows store) using WI-fi works perfectly. Signal: Good reception using either Etisalat/ROSHAN or AWCC service - plenty of supported apps left in the Nokia store...This is the best smart phone I have ever owned, EVER.  I like it slightly better than my New LG Optimus G(!) which I just purchased for stateside use. The screen on this Lumina 900 is beyond HD compliant and quite bright outdoors even in direct sunlight - a very important feature! Battery life is as expected while WI-fi and GPS are enabled, BUT it charges rapidly -especially if using USB 3.0 rapid charge -then it\'s \'incredulous charging speed\'. The phone is comfortable in the hand, not too large, perfect actually for my ordinary male-sized hand; the subtle black texture on the back is of a no-slip design; convenient button placement (especially power on/off); responsive touch/tactile screen. The Carl Zeiss Camera has a lot of available useful adjustments as well as \'set it and forget it\' AUTO settings - Tested: picture quality is excellent - video quality is HD. Overall: Just Perfect - I purchased this as refurbished and unlocked for travel abroad. I paid only $209 USD - worth every cent - This phone came with a brand new packaged micro USB charger; The seller surpassed my expectations with this one! Much appreciated! Will buy again from you as a trusted seller! \'iPhonepros\''),(302,'B00836Y6B2','I bought the Lumia 900 on AT&T; when it first came out.Likes:Operating system.

There are not a whole lot out there.  And there are few if any new ones.  Whenever I go to the \'Store,\' I see the same old dog apps that have been there for the last 1 1/2 years.Camera.  The camera initially worked well, but the lens has become cloudy - and I\'ve taken good care of this phone. As a result it is unusable. Not only are pictures and videos no longer possible, but the phone\'s scan capability has been rendered useless.  I can no longer scan bar codes for price checks.I\'m stuck with this thing for another 7 months till my 2 year contract is up.What a disappointment!  Not so much Microsoft\'s phone system, but Nokia\'s product quality.'),(303,'B00836Y6B2','I wanted to like it, I really did. I just purchased a new Win8 computer and figured I would upgrade my phone to the Lumia 920 in the spirit of homogeneity. Let me tell you that doing so was a HORRIBLE idea - where to start.Weight - this brick, I mean phone,  tips the scales at a cool 185 grams, compared to the 133 gram Galaxy S3 or 140 gram iPhone 4S. When asked why it weighed so much, the salesman told me it was because the phone is made from the same composite as is astronaut helmets.  Nice - I can now sleep better knowing that if the Mayans are right, at least my Lumia 920 is prepared for its journey through the cosmos.To all my skinny jean wearing hipsters, you and this phone simply cannot be - the sheer size and mass of it make it a nightmare to carry in regular sized pants, I can\'t even imagine the kind of dances you\'ll do to get the Lumia in and out of your jeggings pockets. This brick could be a safety hazard if one of these crazy youths tries to rob me on his way to Hot Topic, though my Lumia could possibly double as a shield, or even a weapon if I decided to shotput at my assailant.Onto the UI - wow, anyone who says the apps are incredible must be kidding. Moving past the fact that google refuses to create apps for the Win8 OS, none of the apps that are built for this phone are designed by their actual developers. Facebook is a Microsoft app, Whatsapp doesn\'t even exist, the Pandora app is a blog about the music on Pandora - sweet, nothing satiates my hunger for The Jonas Brothers or Biggie Smalls like the words of Joe and Jane Smith as they opine on hottest 1950\'s Christmas album. What few games they do have, i.e. angry birds, looks like they have been shrunk down from a tv screen onto my phone. The aspect ratio is atrocious, not to mention that for me to download anything, I have to use my Hotmail account that I opened and retired when I was in fifth grade - which may be a real selling point for the hipsters as eclectic/old school schwag is all the rage these days.As per the screen size ... the phone may be huge but a good portion of it is cannibalized by the bezel , again probably some brilliant innovation necessary to make the phone more functional as I use it to fend off attacks but not when I want to compose documents in MS office, which is a function I will NEVER use on my phone.But our friends at Nokia were smart enough to include a wireless charger, this was a HUGE plus, I find that plugging my phone into the wall while I sleep at night is cumbersome AND tedious. Corded phones chargers are so 2010 - what are we still using the rotary phones here? Think of all the extra things I can do now that I don\'t have to plug my brick into the wall! At about 6 hours of battery life, I know that whatever charging device I get is going to get plenty of love.So that\'s it, this phone is horrible. Anyone who says otherwise is either crazy, or is finally making the upgrade from their Razor flip phone. Keep up the good work Nokia, you\'ve successfully kept old school by giving us those old school features we expected in 2005.'),(304,'B00836Y6B2','Switch to Lumia is the new logo from Nokia and you should not wait to do it.WP is a Great OS, i even dare to said is way much better then iOs or Android, it is not only friendly and easy to use but also have a more elegant and modern presentation. This device comes with the version 7.8 which is like using the new Windows Phone 8, so you do not have to worry about the updates.About the hardware: It is an amazing device, in this range of prices you would not find anything better.I am using it in Costa Rica with Kolbi operator and it works like a charm!100% recomended!'),(305,'B00836Y6B2','The design is pretty cool but other than that the phone is a piece of crap; after plugging in some earphones to listen music the sound and the speaker stopped working, troubleshooting the issue I found that many people are having the same issue and that Nokia, Windows or AT&T; are not doing anything about it to fix the problem.hopefully I can get a replacement or at least have it repaired. I do not recommend this specific model at all, perhaps other models are ok but I will not buy a WP anymore.Hope this works for other people thinking about buying this crap phone.'),(306,'B00836Y6B2','I recieved my phone and it came in a cushioned envelope the phone could\'ve been broken. I emailed their customer service representives to inquire about the phone, because I was unable to use the data plan for the phone. I received a email that said and I quote &#34;Hello, This phone is unlocked already you may have to get an updated sim from your carrier in order for all functions to work. Please send me a return request if you would still like to return the phone. Best Regards, Tech Addicts. &#34; No other help I\'m sure this isn\'t the first time that this has happened and why wouldn\'t I have a new SIM card.

It can be found in the marketplace.'),(307,'B00836Y6B2','I really like the Windows OS and the Nokia line after only one day with my phone.  The 900 is great for the most part.  Difficult to set-up the unlocked phone with prepaid carrier, but doable.  The phone itself has a nice look, is dense and operates smoothly. However, feels slick in my hand and almost dropped it many times in the first few hours of handling.  I also think there is much wasted space on the front face at the top and bottom, that the screen doesn\'t use.  Wish it had a 4.5 or better yet a 4.7 inch screen. Also, Nokia needs to adjust the Windows (tiles) to maximize the size to cover the entire screen...too much wasted black space around the edges of the actual screen (not the glass) itself.'),(308,'B00836Y6B2','When I first got this phone I was really excited after hearing so many good things about it and all the nice features it has. However it\'s had a lot of problems and the store I bought it from on Amazon made it out to be a product made for the U.S. but it wasn\'t. As such there was no warranty on my phone and when it started having a lot of problems I had to return it. Amazon was really helpful in this as it was a couple months past the return date and they still gave me a partial refund.Nice Features:Camera: I love this camera. Takes beautiful pics especially up close photos with the macro setting. Colors always come out perfect in the daytime, but in any low light the colors come out really off.User Friendly: I do really like this about the phone. The tiles are fun and easy to use. I really liked the ability to shrink some of the tiles so that you could fit 4 in the place of a big tile, but this quit working on my phone after I was forced to restore it.Dislikes:Windows \'\'Marketplace:\'\' As windows is just starting out there aren\'t really any good apps. There\'s no good map app for one.Cold weather: This bugs me to no end. Any temperature below 60 degrees causes the phone to black out on the bottom half of the screen. If it\'s anywhere near 60 dark lines show up on the screen. You can still use the phone if you know where to click, but the blackened part is all pixely and it takes forever for it to go back to normal.Text/Pic Messaging: I bought this phone to use with Net10. I had to search around everywhere to find the correct codes to enter to get text and pic messaging to work but I finally found them. It worked for a couple months but then it just stopped working. I could send and receive texts, but I could only receive pics, I couldn\'t send them. It was really frustrating since Net10 technically doesn\'t &#34;guarantee\'\' pic messaging so they wouldn\'t help me.Overall, I was really looking forward to this phone, but it\'s really disappointing how much quit working. I don\'t know if just my phone is defective or if this has happened with a lot of people. But it really wasn\'t worth the money I just wish I would\'ve figured it out while I could still get all my money back.'),(309,'B00836Y6B2','First of all 5 stars to the Lumia 900. There are plenty of strong reviews out there so I won\'t bother.But as of early August, 2012 Nokia does not offer a unlocked Lumia 900 to the US market. So ANY phone you get is likely imported, and therefore will only have a warranty in the phones country of origin. Hopefully this is the only downside, I spoke with 4 Nokia reps to try and get all my questions answered. Hardware and software wise... they seem to be and was told that they are identical.Just an FYI.'),(310,'B00836Y6B2','great phone, works well a few problems not many apps and when hold it sideways (for youtube and such) it randomly pops up bing or this really annoying thing that said &#34;try to say call mom or say find a diner&#34; cant figure out what it is or how to shut it off and you cant get more text tones(or I just haven\'t figure it out yet)and you have to use zune to update&#60;add photos from your comp to phone and add music,cant drag and drop like android ..but other than that works well nice size screen nice pic quality easy to make calls and send text nice audio quality and its external speeker is pretty loud'),(311,'B00836Y6B2','I purchased my Lumia 900 from Mobile Tronix. I was concerned at first about the low cost, but after a couple of emails to them, went ahead and ordered. When I got the phone it was in a Nokia box with charger and headphones. The 900 was brand completely new though I was a bit worried at first when I saw the T&T logo in the top right corner. Even more so when on starting up it was all \"T&T\". but as soon as I tried it out it was truly unlocked. After deleting all the contract stuff I now have my own personalised Lumia 900 and am so very pleased with it.'),(312,'B00836Y6B2','soooo ... I had this phone for about 6 months ...compare to my previous android phone, it is simple and easy to use. Windows Phone operating system seems to work more flawlessly than android. (really??? how??)this phone uses a single core processor (supposedly 4 times slower processor), and 512MB RAM (again supposedly 4 times less RAM), but still works more flawlessly than my older android phone (which had better hardware) and android tablet.I am an engineer and a computer geek, but not a phone guru ... I am not a code or application developer :) All I want is a phone that does not get stuck, allows me to check my emails, some simple apps and perhaps games. For all these purposes it works just fine :)Sure it is not an iphone, but it works fine and cost much less  :)I have been a big nokia fan for a long time. I would prefer the old symbian OS, but it is very old ... does not have a lot of applications etc.Would I recommend windows phone to others?  definitely!!!Android phones need quad core processors, and 2GB ram because the operating system is not coded/written elegantly ... thus it needs more processing power to run it, and will probably use more battery power.Why most phone companies go with android then??? well ... it is an older OS ... they simply go with what the most common OS is ...Anyway ... I highly recommend windows OS ... sure it does not have 800 billion apps out there ... but do you really need 10 different versions of angry birds on your phone  :)'),(313,'B00836Y6B2','First, the phone is unlocked, however the one I received was branded with AT&T.;  The phone works great on Net10 (once the settings are figured out, took some time online).Pros: Phone was received 2 days after placing order.  Windows OS is smooth, clean and works.  Previous phone was Android on Sprint.  The call quality is clear as can be. Camera takes very good 8mp photos.  Apps in the market are made for Windows OS so they work.  No bloat ware (there were a few programs pre-installed from AT&T;, however these can be uninstalled).Cons: No external storage (knew this before I bought it), app market is smaller than Android\'s (but how many of those apps are duplicates).  The only real con I can think of is the placement of the USB charging port, it\'s on the top of the phone, but not a deal breaker and I\'m sure I\'ll get used to it.'),(314,'B00836Y6B2','The phone I received is actually locked by at&t; and not unlocked as it says. I asked the seller to send me an unlock code, but he would not respond. after reading some of the comments, I realized that I am not the only one that have been fooled by the phone descrption. Since I am in Angola, West Africa, it is not feasible to send the phone back, therefore I bought an unlock code for $46.6from [...]. It took 10 days to get the code, but the good thing is my phone is unlocked and working pretty well.'),(315,'B00836Y6B2','I was a devoted Blackberry user for the last 5 years. When the Windows phone came out I was interested, and when I won one I was thrilled! Now that I\'ve had the chance to play with and use the Nokia 900 here are my thoughts.First, wow. This is supposed to be THE camera for those who want great pictures. YEAH RIGHT. Nearly all of my pictures turn out blurry, and if I zoom in...OH.MY.GOSH. They are truly terrible. Pixelated and just horrid. This is most definitely NOT what I expected from this phone\'s camera!Another huge downfall for me is the inability to choose which album my photos go to when I share them to Facebook. This is a developer issue, I believe, not necessarily the phone\'s issue (but maybe it is?), but it is a BIG deal to me. I don\'t want photos to just go to my \"mobile uploads\".I miss my speed-dial option. I used to have a set key to call my house and my husband\'s cell phone, I am unable to do this with the 900. :(I also found it too easy to change the sound for the ringtone and in-call while in your pocket (or purse) or while you are actually talking/using the phone.Another thing I dislike is the ability to change the calendar view permanently. I prefer month view, but you cannot get month view to stay on your calendar settings, only daily view and then you have to touch to see the month view. A minor annoyance, but still very cumbersome to me.The battery life is unimpressive. With minor use I go through my battery in less than 10 hours. I need a battery that lasts longer. Even with the battery saver turning on it doesn\'t do enough. Also, if you prefer to have a light background vs the dark background you will go through your battery even faster. Have a car charger available!Another HUGE thing is the inability to select text. I often want to copy text that is in an email and I am unable to do this with the Lumia 900. Huge disappointment and another reason I miss Blackberry. :/Things I do like... I like the Windows OS. I like the Windows 8 OS better than this 7.5 Mango, but it\'s not all that bad. I like the ability to have multiple alarms. I like the screen, it\'s large and beautiful. The touch screen is pretty accurate, and I was able to transfer from the actual qwerty keyboard to the virtual one fairly easily ( I was very tentative of this).The apps that are available are great, there are plenty of free apps that are great to have. I love that I can watch Netflix on this device!

The instruction booklet looked like the printer att had used ran out of ink. you cannot read either book. It has online instructions to compensate for that.

But in the ad I bought from, it said that the phone is NEW, FACTORY UNLOCKED.  Hmmm, curious.  Then the phone MAY be used or new or a refurbished model restored to operable condition.  Bottom line.... is this a NEW PHONE with a valid AT&T / Nokia warranty?  The ad doesn\'t say any of this other stuff / B.S. in it.  That\'s unfair.  I like buying from Amazon too.

I loved my iPhone when I  first got it, though found that it had many controlling issues, iTunes is your gateway.

I had a lager amount invested in songs and apps so when I got the 920 I was happy to find out that when I plugged. In my phone and download the phone syncing app from Microsoft  that part of it was to pull all of my iTunes music over on to my new phone, my photos also where synced from iTunes. The only items that I was not able to get out of iTunes where my tv episodes and movies. I do not know if this is because I loaded them to iTunes from digital copies and did not buy them directly from iTunes or that all video media will not transfer. I now can go to the office or there computer and play the music from my phone over the computer with out any other software loaded other then a music player. I also am able to load any file onto my phone wth out their part apps, or the use of an iTunes type syncing software. I did not like that even though I may have had a file saved to my computer through itunes I  could not open it on my computer. I had to go to my phone and then e-mail that file to myself even though it was already on my computer in I iTunes just not available. I can go from computer to phone one file at a time or many to one all at once. With iTunes is all or nothing when syncing. I also like that mote websites work so that I.

But when I saw a review for the upcoming WP8.1, I really wanted to upgrade.So I went with this phone, the Nokia Lumia 920. It\'s definitely an upgrade from its predecessor, and in more ways than just the OS. The screen is really sleek and juts out instead of being framed by the casing (like in the case of the 900). This makes it easier to interact with the edges of apps that take up the entire screen. Also, I love the processing speed and graphics quality; games look pretty good and perform well on this phone.The fact that it runs on WP8 instead of the 900\'s WP7.5 is great. I didn\'t know how much I was missing until I started using the 920. There are so many more apps and customizable settings on WP8, making it really, really feel that WP is catching up to Android and iOS.The camera is pretty beast too. It takes clearer pictures than the one on the 900\'s, and the post-picture-taking zoom (I don\'t know the correct term, sorry) is definitely a lot better. The Nokia Camera app is really nice; I can feel like a picture-taking pro when I use it hahaha.All in all, I really like this phone.

I am used to being able to customize my phone to my liking with android so windows will take a little bit to get used to. with all that being said there is not enough info from this seller about the phone. I would have liked to see that the phone was an unlocked GSM and it only takes micro sim cards which was a shock after I tried to find out where the sim card went.( you need something small like a needle to push the slot out on the top of the phone) It was a really weird spot to place the card. but anyway with being a Samsung fan I feel like this phone lacks so much in user interface. Its supposed to be easy to navigate with the tiles but man getting to the settings and figuring out where things are is confusing. took me a while to figure out the phone had NFC but at the same time certain files wont send through like with the GS3. I will be commenting again on this again later on.Update 8/26/13* Ok I have played with this phone and tried to figure things out and got a good feel for it but man compared to android and IOS this things SUCKS! the major apps that you would use daily are rated 3 at best because they are so horrible.

I really wanted a good text to speech phone. I have carpel tunnel and need a good speech to test function.It\'s HEAVY - if you have carpel tunnel forget it. this phone made my hands ache (I\'ve had CTS)The virtual keyboard is harder to use - shorter and does not go from edge to edge of the screen.

Those extra ounces really add up after a few hours. On the other hand, it is durable and you could KO someone with it.I expected it to be just like Windows 8 for the desktop - but there are huge differences. Perhaps it\'s not a big deal to most people but MS was advertising a whole new common look and feel to it\'s phone, tablet and desktop. I have had the desktop for over a month and returned to Win7.

This phone did come unlocked and works with a t-mobile sim card. I did purchase this phone new but like most users here I received it used with minor scratches and sadly only came with the charger. I did however manage to get some sort of discount for this condition. Above all this phone is great for any shutterbug. The touch screen is sensitive-- more so than my iPad2!!Now for the cons: not a lot of apps, which is okay! I\'m not much of an app user. The only apps I really use on the 920 are facebook, gmail, skydrive and instagraph.that being said the battery life is pretty poor. I was quite shocked after the 100% charge i had it before I slept but then in the morning it dropped to 89%. WOW. What happened? Apparently this is a major problem that Nokia/Microsoft haven\'t really (at least what I think) brought up. Google tips on how to increase the battery life.Note: this phone is heavier than you might actually expect. But with that aside I\'m pretty happy with my purchase. If weight is an issue then wait for the 925.That\'s why I gave this 4/5 stars.---- Update 7/18/13Now I rate this 2/5 given that the battery life has been dropping more since I tried to increase it. The phone is a phone hog. I\'ve turned off some apps, other items on the phone and put it on the not recommend battery saver mode, but the phone is still sucking up the battery like no other. I may have had a faulty phone... but my experience with it is pretty poor.Poor battery = slow loading time = unhappy customer. I returned this phone and am going to wait for the Nexus 5.'),(327,'B009ZC90P0','This is not a good mobile phone, I\'m 6/18/13 buy mobile phone, is now the only 8/12/13. yesterday in the video process is suddenly interrupted, the screen is only a faint glow. But it can not be used, this is my second time to buy the mobile phone in the Amazon. The first to buy a mobile phone is in the 6/10/13 date, I gave it to my brother. Is a very bad.Their mobile phone are rubbish? I have checked the chance of no return. Return in 30 days, now only use no more than 3 months, the two mobile phone have been unable to use, I also have sought to write position, but did not find, I really do not know how to ask for help, they are also my disappointment.Amazon Co should let the factory have quality assurance, this is no reputable manufacturers, use only could no longer use no more than three months, can not boot'),(328,'B009ZC90P0','I have an I-phone 4s. Compare to the Nokia Lumia 920,the I-phone 4s is garbage. The Nokia 920 is faster, the display is much much better, the battery performance is better, and the camera is out of this world. So what else is to be said about it. Great job Nokia. At first, I was concerned about the weigh of the phone, but it was nothing. The phone is perfect the way it is. It feel great in my hand. So far, I have no complain about the phone and the only thing I regret is not buying sooner. Lets see what happen in the future.'),(329,'B009ZC90P0','It\'s beautiful, easy to use and so fast!. Microsoft do the best work with the OS and Nokia with the phone. Only two issues: First: At the time i received it in my country (Venezuela), four months later (thanks LibertyExpress), I need to Update the phone 5 times (3 updates for Windows Phone, two for Nokia - Lumia Amber and Black) to get the best experience. That was so easy. And second: It has the AT&T; logo, but it\'s okay, it\'s unlocked.Finally, I have a Smartphone that covers all my mobile needs. I have a powerful camera (Perhaps no more powerful than the Lumia 1020) and now I have a very good reason to celebrate, since I came back to buy one of the Nokia\'s best masterpieces.'),(330,'B009ZC90P0','- Screen has perfect size and brightness - good view even in direct sunlight of the most sunny days- Almost indestructible - and yes, I needed that :) Search for it at youtube and you will see the kind of \"read-life\" resistance tests that this phone passes...- Best camera - same quality of a good point and shoot; image stabilization allows for good photos without flash- 32Gb storage is more than enough to store music and lots of photos. Combine it with skydrive and you won\'t need more.- Dual-core proc and LTE makes it FAST - loads Skype and Facebook almost immediately. Multi-task is also very smart.. it doesn\'t matter how many apps you have opened - I never noticed any loss in performance!- Wireless charging was a big surprise. It works and it is FAST! It was not a need, but I have to admit - it is very convenient.- Windows Phone 8 interfaceCons:- Like majority of phones it is not water proof... this would be a nice add to make it really indestructible.- Every time I compare it with the new HTC the 920 seems too big and heavy... I just don\'t believe how HTC could make it! But I preferred to stay with Nokia due to exclusive apps, and wireless charging (and mainly Nokia brand that gave me more confidence of having good signal and voice quality - but this is brand perception, I have to hard data to support it)'),(331,'B009ZC90P0','I have had this phone for 5 days now and am thrilled. I ordered it from AT&T; though. It is a beautiful phone with all the features that I need. The phone is fast and elegant. I have heard people complain about lack of apps for Windows 8, but I did not find that to be true. It has all the necessary apps that I can use. Nokia has produced a beautiful equipment.The camera is amazing, call quality great and the wireless connection to internet is fast.  GPS is great. It even warns when you exceed speed limit.Nokia maps is very good.The screen quality is outstanding and very responsive.Number of voice commands need to increase though. Hopefully by next update, it will have voice commands to set alarms, appointments etc. I could not find a way to \'Cut and Paste\' ( It has \'Copy and Paste\').'),(332,'B009ZC90P0','This is one of the best phones that I have used in a while. It has a nice weight to it that makes it feel very secure in my hands, which is a huge plus. I\'m known for destroying my phones on concrete and legdes and stuff of that nature. I love the Windows Os system. It makes navigation extremely easy, just make sure that you download the \"Here Drive +\" app before you make any trips. I was going to a party, and didn\'t have it downloaded, and could not get directions. But the only thing I would have a problem with, would be the battery life. It\'s pretty short. One way to optimize the use of battery make sure everything is turned off, and put the battery save on. you\'ll get about 2 and a half days on stand by and about 10 using apps. Other than that, that\'s it. Overall AMAZING phone, I would recommend it to anyone looking to be different, or a change in Os systems.'),(333,'B009ZC90P0','If you read somewhere that anyone who buys this phone customarily goes into a brain-gasm for five minutes of holding it - you read the truth.I did a whole lot of research and contemplation before making this purchase - and now I wish I had not spent that week without this beauty. The top contenders were iPhone 5, Galaxy S4, HTC 8X, HTC One and Lumia 920. I chose Lumia and here\'s why:Design:This is clearly the best selling point for the 920. Sure, iPhone 5 feels solid but Lumia with its premium (plastic?) and its weight feels as sturdy and nice. HTC 8X and One have sturdy bodies too - but somehow still feel cheap and smudge-prone. Galaxy S4 really loses the plot (for me) on design. It feels even more cheap and light and plastic than my old S2.I got the white one - against all taunts and persuasions from my girlfriend - but both of us now agree it does NOT look girly. Plus, its glossy look stays clear of fingerprints and dirt - and ends up looking more professional than the black. That\'s a big plus for me.I also like how the screen juts out of the white body by half a mm - feels great in the hand. I was a little worried about the waste of real estate towards the bottom bezel - but after using the phone - I barely notice it - and in fact like having that extra space for the home/back/search buttons.The weight is great - yes it does feel significantly heavier than any other phone out there - but you know what - it should feel like that - this is a substantial phone - and the weight also works to provide balance in hand.OS/Apps:Windows Phone OS is great - it\'s fluid beyond anything iOS or Android can offer and fortunately Microsoft is putting all its weight behind it. Everything works smooth, fast and looks like a million bucks. The Nokia-specific apps - Here Maps, Drive, Transit - are better than any other geo apps out there, period. I use public transit and nothing beats Here Transit.That been said, the Windows Phone store still lacks a lot of apps it shouldn\'t by now. There is no reliable Yellow Cab app, no Wells Fargo app, no decent Guitar tuner app in the store. But hopefully, as Windows Phone gets more popular - these shall follow.Oh and Nokia Music - so basically Nokia Music is like a Pandora service - which lets you listen to unlimited music mixes for free online but also allows you to download upto four such mixes for free for offline listening. Yes, you read this right. It IS that awesome. I use it everyday to the extent I no longer have any of my own music library on the phone.Other Features:The phone does not have FM. However it appears that the phone has always had the hardware for it - it just has been dormant. There is going to be a Lumia Amber update coming to the device very soon - which will enable FM. I could not ask for more.Wireless charging is a nice little feature - but I haven\'t personally used it. The camera looks great on specs - and almost everybody who has reviewed the phone has said the quality is fantastic - I haven\'t had a chance to really test the camera out.Nokia has of course brought out other Lumias after the 920 (925, 1020, 928). All of these offer the same set of features and quality (1020 of course gives you a 41 MP camera) - but if you want a phone that feels substantial in your hand or pocket and has a great finish overall - 920 is still the one to buy.'),(334,'B009ZC90P0','Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5\" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning\'s Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn\'t have a removable battery cover, which means you can\'t access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree,is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset,Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight BlackandJayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight BlackAll the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don\'t have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.'),(335,'B009ZC90P0','The item arrived on time. Actually earlier than what it was expected to be! The phone was in fact unlocked, came with the nokia charger and the ear plugs. Everything was totally new so I am truly relieved! I was kind of unsure thanks to the bad Reviews about purchasing it but I couldn\'t be happier with Voltage Converter Store Seller. Excellent!I like the screen and even though everyone comments about how heavy it feels when handling it, I am a girl and trust me.... It\'s not that bad. It is not that heavy, when I felt it on hand, It just felt ok.. so if you are worry about it being a tank, it is not.'),(336,'B009ZC90P0','I purchased this phone because I was under the impression that it supported the 4G bands necessary to run on T-mobile with data.I received the phone and set up the T-mobile Sim along with the phones set up. So far so good everything working and it was fast!Then after everything was set up I decided to download apps and update the phone, I then enabled WIFI to speed up the process. After the updates and downloads I turned off WIFI to test the speed of the network. Now with my old phone I get 4G speeds &#34;not LTE&#34; at my house so I was expected the same speed or better. Then I saw in the top left corner it was full bars with a little G next to it which made me exited because I thought the G meant 3g or 4g. But it turns out that G means the step down from Edge. So when I tried using the browser my phone just sat there and gave up before it loaded even Google. And after some more research I found out that the data would only work on T-mobiles &#34;reformed&#34; networks which are only available in 49 cities.But, for my experience with the phone.Pro- Nice size, has some heft to it, it doesn\'t have that cheep feel to it, The screen size is not to small perfect if you have trouble with seeing the small screen of an IPhone. It\'s also fast the UI (User Interface) works well. Call quality is superb and the speakers are loud, but they are loud enough to hear if it\'s sitting on a table in front of you. And the camera is what you expect very good with the duel flash.Cons- The lock button is in a awkward place between the camera and volume rocker, you will find your self changing the volume long before you unlock the phone. If you like having a lot of information at a glace while the device is still locked you will be a little disappointed by the customization. Also if you like having a lot of live tiles at the top for you to see you will run into a problem that you can only fit around 4-5 live tiles with out making them tiny before you have to scroll to see the information. Also a side note, when it\'s charging and you use the phone the battery gets really hot.Other than a couple little complains the phone seems good, but i only could look at it use it a couple times before I decided I wanted to use data on my smart phone. If it worked with my provider I would have kept the phone and strongly recommend this phone to people who want a phone that works well and doesn\'t have the distractions of messing with every setting in the world before it works perfectly.'),(337,'B009ZC90P0','NOKIA LUMIA 920 Drop test[...]NOKIA LUMIA 920 Video[...]I have used Iphone 4s then Galaxy S3; both of those were not too bad. However, there is always something unknown that made me feel in-completed  and unsatisfied using smartphones until I got Nokia Lumia 920. This phone can do much better my Canon Rebel II Ti on video recording, and it is very portable and convenient.  It also replaces the GPS navigation devices and actually does better job than them.The Nokia Lumia 920 has all the practical use, solid quality, excellent performance, and extreme durability.  Because NOKIA people wants to prove to the world that they are capable of produce the best phone to catch attention from consumers. That is why they try to put a lot of breakthrough technologies into one package. The NOKIA LUMIA 920 has many 1st in the world of smartphones. Here they are:1. The 1st optical image stabilization with Carl Zeiss optics/ low light camera in a smartphone2. The 1st super sensitive screen that can be used with glove in a smartphone3. The 1st 60 fps screen refresh rate in a smartphone4. The 1st wireless charging smartphone5. The 1st Virtual reality City Lens. Hardware: A-gps + GLONASS (Seven years ago NOKIA introduced the world\'s first smartphone with GPS and navigation. Now, Nokia Lumia 920 and Nokia Lumia 820 are introducing the first autonomously assisted GPS and GLONASS receivers)6. The 1st or one of the first 4G/ LTE supported ?7. Maybe the 1st smartphone that you can throw against a concrete wall, and it still works (b/c of its Corning Gorilla Glass 2 and poly-carbonate body).8. The clearest and loudest microphone/speaker of smartphones that I have been ever using.What else: Active noise cancellation with dedicated mic, rich audio recording, Dolby stereo sound, luxury hot design award, Wifi N-dual band, free NOKIA maps, drive, and apps to travel the world, free virtual reality location City Lens, free NOKIA music... more.This kind of phone don\'t come around very often (like NOKIA 808). Who knows perhaps in the next version, Nokia might not use some or all of the above technologies trying to make their phone much thinner and lighter.'),(338,'B009ZC90P0','My switch from apple to windows:  Let me just say I have never really been a fan of the iPhone. It\'s just not my personal preference. I know there are plenty of people that like it, but not me...I was worried though switching from my iPhone to something where my app options were going to be completely foreign. Even if I love windows 8 for my desktop - I was hesitant about going to windows 8 mobile. I\'m SO GLAD I made the change.Also, here is a novel idea. When I plug this thing into my computer via usb - guess what happens.....I CAN VIEW MY FILES AND MUSIC. I never wanted to resort to jailbreaking my iPhone because it permanently damaged my boyfriend\'s phone, and another friend we have had a heck of a time with his jailbreak. While this may be a problem that is generally few and far between - being as I was running my phone on a prepaid network and already had issues with that, I didn\'t want to jailbreak the phone. I shouldn\'t have to jailbreak a phone that is meant to play music in order to complete the generally simple task of loading music on the dang thing.The actual physical phone: I love the slim & sleek design, the very easy to use touch screen, the sensitivity adjustments for the touch screen, and the overall quality and feel. The screen size is perfect for my use. I was considering getting a tablet before I had this phone, and while this isn\'t exactly tablet-sized...I may actually skip the tablet for the time being.'),(339,'B009ZC90P0','I\'ve had two Lumia 900s, both suffered drops that cracked the screen (though they also made it safely through quite a few drops, I am a klutz).  So I decided to get the 920, and I am thrilled with it.  It comes in some gorgeous colors (bright yellow!), and it has such a beautiful and sleek form factor that I\'m loathe to put it in a case (hence my blue Lumia 900\'s vulnerability to drops). It gets excited looks and questions wherever I go.  Last week I took it out during a meeting with about 15 of our marketing folks (predominantly young guys), and it ended up getting passed around the room with lots of positive chatter - until the conversation turned to apps.  I agree, it has most of the apps I want, but not all of the ones that I used consistently on my iPhone, and that has been the downfall of Nokia phones in recent history.The marketing campaign for the 900 was all about how everyone had been a smartphone beta tester, and this was the real deal. Followed closely by a software glitch bad enough that Nokia then gave a credit to everyone who bought a subsidized phone that made the phone FREE. There are still some problems with the Lumia line. This Lumia has had some rebooting issues, the battery life is still not great (you are running on vapors by the end of every day), and it\'s hefty. It fits in a pocket, but you really feel it, especially if you sit down.  All in all, however, I do love this phone and I love having something that not everyone else has.PROS*Form Factor: it\'s different, and gorgeous, and a conversation starter.  People want it, or want to try it.*Camera: It has a great 8.7 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization (Carl Zeiss, as always with Nokia) and takes good images even inside my house even with curtains drawn.  Sharp.*Screen: 4.5 inch screen with gorilla glass, stunningly sharp 1280 x 760 resolution and blur reduction.  It is also impressively sensitive.  Nokia is based in Finland, and they have 10 months of cold. Nokia engineers have been very motivated to make a phone that can be used while wearing gloves.*Operating System: The Windows operating system features bold, bright colors, animated images, and a very intuitive and easy interface.  I try to restrict my conversations with friends because inevitably people ask to play with the pretty interface and seem to have no qualms about opening my personal email, work email, and texts. I\'m still not sure how much I like it that this phone is so attractive and attracting that it makes people forget boundaries.*Responsiveness: Superb. It has a dual-core processor, but it\'s optimized to run smoothly on slower chips. 60 fps screen refresh rate. It\'s zippy in most everything you do. 4G/LTE supported.*Maps: best in the business, and Nokia Drive is awesome. I used the 920 when I was in Chicago and it got me where I wanted to go via buses (I know, I\'m cheap) every day with no issues (bus times, stop locations, etc).*Some sweet extras: wireless charging and near field communication. And they finally give you a way to resize your tiles, a lack that annoyed me with the 900. Also interfaces with my Xbox 360. I still can\'t set up my TV programs to record (via my cable provider) like I could with my iPhone however.*Sound: one of the things that seems improved - music quality is not bad if I forget my headphones and I can carry on business calls via speaker.*Price: a LOT cheaper than an iPhone.CONS*Size: heavy, big in your pocket and just slightly too big to be comfortable in your hand.*Battery: Yes, it\'s a jaw-droppingly beautiful display, but a little shorter battery life is the result.*Operating System: Still some glitches. Nokia did spit out the Lumia line pretty quickly after the partnership with Microsoft was inked, and they are still on an aggressive timeline.  The company is in trouble, and clearly is trying to strike the balance between getting this phone into people\'s hands while still maintaining quality.*My plea to Nokia: I want to see the time/date and notifications without activating the phone. I loved the N9 for that.  Please bring that functionality to Lumia.'),(340,'B009ZC90P0','I\'ve been wanting this Windows phone since its release and have finally plop down the money for one.  First of all, the type:  Nokia Lumia 920 unlocked white International version (RM-821).  The biggest difference between international version RM-821 and AT&T;\'s RM-820 is that AT&T;\'s RM-820 is locked (need to get unlock code from AT&T;) and AT&T;\'s version support AT&T;\'s 4G network.  Since I use this with pay as you go on AT&T; network, I usually turn the data OFF unless I really need it (rare).  My RM-821 does see AT&T; 3G, AT&T; LTE 1 Lumia and AT&T; LTE 2 Lumia.  The biggest advantage of RM-821 over AT&T;\'s branded version is ... whatever updates Nokia/Microsoft announces, you get immediately instead of waiting for AT&T; to get theirs.  eg. I got the GDR2/Amber update way before official AT&T; version get theirs.The phone itself:Beautiful.  The screen is bright, the back side is shiny, and it holds nicely in my hand.  32 GB of memory means I\'m not fighting for space between my music, photos, videos and apps.  It\'s a bit heavy/big (according to my wife) but I love the weight and size (4.5\") comparing to my previous (Nokia 710 : Windows Phone 7.8)  I was debating if I want to pay an extra $100 bucks for the 925 or $800 bucks for the unlocked 1020.  The 1020 looks awesome but $800 bucks unlocked (or $609 on AT&T;) is a bit steep.  925 looks nice but 16GB RAM is a deal breaker.  Most Amazon vendor sells Lumia 920 for about $350 - $360.  I\'ve also thought about the 820, which has micro SD slot but with a lower end camera, display and 8GB RAM, the 920 is worthy of their price.The camera:This is one of the main reason I got this phone:  the PureView technology 8.7MP is awesome in low light!  Go try it at a retail store that has it on display and you\'ll know what I mean.  GDR2 update brings Nokia Pro Cam into the mix, allowing you to quickly mess with ISO, white balance, shutter speed, manual focus, and exposure compensation if you wish.  Love the slide to zoom option (even in video!).  The location of the camera is a bit too toward the middle since my finger sometimes gets in the way; I guess I just need to hold it the right way :pProcessor:Feels pretty snappy since it was the flag ship phone.  Lumia 925/928/1020 all uses the same processor.Wireless charging:I haven\'t had the chance to play with this so you\'ll have to read other people\'s review for that one.NFC:I was looking forward to this since most Android phones can share photos via NFC.  I\'ve tried it with a Nexus 7 and no dice.  I looked online and noticed that Android\'s implementation is different than Windows 8 ... so the sharing of photos/video is only possible Nokia to Nokia and Android to Android.  You CAN, how ever share URLs and contacts (remember to do the share, choose tab+send)Maps:Offline maps is one of the reason I love this phone (Nokia in general) since you can download the map ahead of time and not worry about having data access to use the GPS option.Apps:Windows store may not have as many apps as iOS or Android, it has enough for me.  There are only so many apps one can consume before you see variations of an idea.  If it\'s a concern for you, go search the Windows Phone Store for apps before you buy a Windows phone.Sync:Yeah.  People complained about this online because Microsoft is moving away from Zune for Desktop.  To get your stuff synced between your PC and your phone, I use Zune to organize the music/video/photo/playlist and \"Windows Phone app for Desktop\" to do the syncing.  It\'s clumsy but it works for me.Update on Sync:  (10/18/2013)The playlist still messes up from time to time.  One thing that works is:  once you connect your phone, it\'s treated like a USB thumb drive device.  To muck with the play list (correctly):1. have \"Windows Phone app for Desktop\" sync the music you want2. use File browser to navigate to whatever-you-name-your-phone\\Phone\\Music\\Playlist (you need to enable \"Show Hidden files, folders, and drives\" if you stay with Microsoft defaults)3.  right click on a playlist (something you need to create in Zune) and choose \"Properties\"4.  Click on the \"References tab\" and it will show you the songs in the playlist5.  To add songs, drag existing songs on your phone to the playlistOver all, it\'s a solid phone, I\'ve grown to like Windows tiles and apps are on the increase.'),(341,'B009ZC91AY','I love this phone.  My very slightly out of warranty iPhone went kaput and replacing it while still under ATT contract would have cost me a fortune. The Nokia Lumia 920 is nicer than the iPhone, in my opinion. All the apps I would ever need are included or free at the store. The display is nicer than the iPhone display. Collecting my contacts and storing them in the new phone was painless. The wireless charging with the optional wireless charger is sweet! I come home after work and set my phone on the pad.  In less than 30 minutes my phone is fully recharged.  The price is right.  There is a lot of bang for the buck with this phone.'),(342,'B009ZC91AY','Product match all depends on what you\'re looking for and for me, this is turning out to be a fantastic product.  Handset size is certainly something of choice, depending on how you\'re planning on using your phone, I was looking for something I could use as a phone/communications/productivity/navigational tool.Pros:-Call quality and signal: excellent so far, even in areas with traditionally poor signal.-Nokia city view: Love it, very handy when I\'m traveling and it has an awesome \'interactive\' feel to it.-Microsoft office integration: fantastic,syncing through your live account is easy and controlled, you only put what you want onto someone else\'s server and maintaining that split is easy for both contacts/calendars.  OneNote syncing is the same way, again, very controlled and then seamless once you\'ve setup what you\'re willing to share.-Email:  Love the windows 8 tiles (for the phone, I have the opposite feeling for the desktop and I\'m ambiguous on the tablet) for separate email accounts, very handy for splitting work/business/priorities since you can control what notifies to your lock screen per tile.-Overall OS feel: again excellent, surprisingly so actually.  I was expecting more bugs but this is really polished and slick.-App store: there\'s enough here to be functional, which is all I wanted ~ although someone really wanting a plethora of games will be disappointed.  The nav/prod side is solid though.-The Win7 desktop phone app ~ is really all about syncing your itunes to your windows phone and its AWESOME.  Best itunes/win translation I\'ve seen.  Its bare bones visually, but recognizes all of your non-DRM content and pulls your playlists and catalog seamlessly from iTunes.-The phone itself: great design, high quality, excellent feel.  Camera is fantastic (amateur photog - it won\'t replace my larger cameras/lenses but I might just dump my point and click for it).-New features: haven\'t tried out things like smartglass yet, but I\'m excited about the queue of features coming out for the windows phone and what it can do as part of the msft platform.-Micro usb:  I can\'t tell you how happy I am they used a common standard as their physical interface/charging port.  :)Cons:-Win7 desktop phone app ~ can\'t sync to your office suite directly, you can upload docs but it wont\' handle merges/changes like the online sync does.  Given msft\'s segmentation of their business lines, not surprising but I\'d like to see it added at some point.-ATT-Lack of documentation ~ this is annoying.  Very poor documentation on W8 phone and google turns up results about the OS, not the phone implementation.  The limited manual that comes with the phone runs out real quick for usefulness.  I disagree with their naming strategy, when I google the iphone (my family has them) finding the answer is easy, ditto with an ipad or an apple OS problem (have those as well) but with the win8 phone I can\'t find a good segmented knowledge source just about the phone section of the OS.'),(343,'B009ZC91AY','COME ON! With a camera like that-  like THAT Nokia, what the hell is the deal with a measly 32GB??? This phone rocks, rocks like a boss - OR WOULD rock like a boss if it had the storage capacity of the modern century. It\'s ridiculous, if you\'re an audiophile - like me! And a serious pro photographer - again like me! 32GB will go like yesterdays hot wings.Bottom line if you are like me and make a lot of pics and listen to a ton of photos, this phone can\'t handle it, not at 32GB. But if you don\'t have music and wouldn\'t bother making a lot of great photos with the amazing camera on this phone, then by all means buy it. It is a fantastic device.'),(344,'B009ZC91AY','I have been a fan of the MS devices since the zune, so I am a bit of a fanboy, but I have owned a Galaxy device, and my wife owns an iPhone 4S, so I do have actual comparisons to make.  If you are locked into the Apple ecosystem, you may want to stop reading, as there is a sharp difference coming from all Apple products, but if you have an open mind, or are tired of the same junk getting pushed on you from a closed ecosystem, then read on.The OS:  MS took the best of a closed ecosystem like Apple\'s, wherein they control the look of the OS, and the overall functionality and reliability, but took a page from Android, and are letting OEM\'s create individual hardware to suit different needs/desires.  The OS is fluid and fast, there is hardly ever a hang-up, and it just works.  I have found no bugs, and I find the structure of the OS to be very intuitive.  iOS tend to bury certain settings functions deep within other settings, and can be cumbersome to change, like turning on and off cellular data, which on the iPhone can take a long time, and on the Lumia I can do it in about 2 seconds and then be right into whatever I needed the data for (I switch it on and off a lot because I have a low data plan, just too expensive to pay for data when Wi-Fi is readily available and free in most places I go).The live tiles are fun, and the ability to add just the people I want from my contacts to my start screen and get just their updates keeps me from spending most of my life on Facebook.  I can see what they posted, and I don\'t care much about anyone else, and if I want to post something, it is just a press away.  Same with Twitter and many other social services.The ever-scrolling tiles on one screen is much faster and more intuitive than having pages and pages to scroll through, again, makes doing what I want much quicker than on other OS\'s.MS did their customers a favor by providing semi-regular updates that you don\'t need to buy a new phone for.  I still have an original WP7 device that I use as my work phone (had to drill out the camera and wasn\'t doing that to my Lumia), and it has received up through the 7.5 update.  It is almost 3 years old and works as good as the day I got it, albeit with a more limited app selection since most devs are not making WP7.X compatible apps, and instead are focusing on WP8, but it functions and the experience is similar from 7 to 8.  If this were an Android phone, I would have had to root it to upgrade the OS (as I did on my Galaxy S), and in order to stay current, Android OEMs force you into buying a new phone, well before the 2 year cycle of most carriers, which can be expensive and annoying.  At least MS tried to keep the ability to update an old phone, but I understand why they chose to change that from WP7 to WP8, a necessary evil.If you have kids, this is the phone for you.  The Kid Zone is the best thing for smartphone owners with children: put just the apps and media you want there, and that is all your kids can do.  They can\'t buy stuff, or surf the web, and they can still play games and be entertained.Finally, the OS does not slow down over time like Android does.  That was my biggest complaint about my Galaxy S was that after a few months I would have to do a hard-reset and start from scratch, very annoying.  The only hard reset I\'ve had to do with a WPx device was to try to fix the screen problem I had that Nokia fixed for me.The Hardware:  It is difficult to find a phone that compares to Nokia\'s upper echelon phones.  The build quality is excellent, it holds up to the beatings of my children and random drops, and the camera is top-notch.  I would love to have the 1020 for the infinite zoom and 41MP, but the 920 holds its own against just about any other phone out there.  The dedicated camera button allows me to quickly snap a photo and not have to fumble around with the phone in order to get the camera going, and if I get a good shot that I want to share, sending to facebook or IM or email is just a swipe to the right away.The sound with and without headphones is great on this phone, although my wife\'s iPhone 4S seems to be a bit crisper, but it is a great improvement over my old WP7 phone which was inaudible without headphones.Wireless charging... need I say more?  I set it down on my bed-side table in the dark, and pick it up when my alarm goes off in the morning without fumbling with wires.The screen is a thing to be seen, especially in bright sunlight.  The auto brightness combined with Nokia technology here makes it the envy of most other phones outside during the day.  The colors look a bit funny in that super-bright mode, but that shift of brightness and saturation is better than not being able to see the screen at all.Overall, I would recommend this phone to anyone fed up with their current phone.  Most people want to dismiss MS as not being able to put out a quality product, and may be turned off by older versions of other MS products (Vista anyone?...), but they hit a home run with this one.  Go into a store and play around with the demo model, and then take it for a test drive.  Mess around in the settings and read a forum or two to find out everything it can do (took me forever to discover you could turn off Facebook calendars so I stop getting birthday announcements for random people that I friended for various FB games), and give it an honest try.'),(345,'B009ZC91AY','To give some background, I have been an iPhone user since the first one was introduced in 2007.  I loved my iPhone.  It did everything I needed and more.  As more and more options came out, I was interested in what else was out there and decided to give this phone a try.  LEt me start with the hardware:Pros:-I love the screen size.  This is one of the things that attracted me to this phone because I really wanted something bigger and felt that the iPhone 5 really didn\'t add to the screen size as I had hoped.- I couldn\'t ask for a better camera, it is awesome.  One of the best I have seen in a cell phone.- The feel of the phone.  It just feels solid and well constructed.  Some phones feel flimsy and cheap, but not this one.  Some people don\'t like this because of the weight, but I don\'t find it to be that heavy.- Wireless charging built into the device.Cons:- I wish the camera was placed a little differently.  It is right in the middle of the phone and I find myself covering the lens when shooting one handed.- It doesn\'t have expandable memory.  I thought this is something everyone used to differentiate themselves from the iPhone.One thing to mention is the battery life.  I was lucky if I made it through the day on a single charge when I got the phone.  After letting it drain completly and doing a full charge, the battery life has improved greatly.  I can now go about two days with no issues.Now the Software.  I have to admit that the Windows look and feel is totally different from iPhone or even Android.  I find some things to be easier to navigate.  I also think that there was some bad choices made that make it less intuitive.  This OS also has the feeling of an immature platform.  After having been out for two years, I expected a lot more from it.  It does not have a lot of the top apps yet.  MS is working on this, but it shows.  I also feel that there is a lack of quality apps compared to the iPhone apps.ONe of the biggest complaints, as mentioned above, is just the immaturity of the platform.  There are certain things that I would consider critical that are just missing.  ONe fo the biggest that has plagued me the last few days is playlists in the music app.  You can create them on the phone if you use some roundabout set of instructions.  Once you do this, there is no way to edit the playlist.  You can simply delete it.  Also, the app that is used for syncing has absolutely no functionality and cannot handle anything like this.  There are other things that pop up like this that make me grumble and check my eligibility for an upgrade.My overall impression is that the hardware is solid.  The OS is lacking.  All of the issues I have mentioned can be fixed in a SW update, but I will be switching back to my iPhone when I can and dropping this phone.'),(346,'B009ZC91AY','I must preface this review by stating that I am a Nokia employee and all following comments may be tainted by incidental bias.  Also coffee.I must also state that I am a button-pusher.  All day I push buttons here and there.  I push them almost everywhere.  I\'ve come to love the button push.  I\'ve come to love it very much.I\'m not a touchscreen sort of guy.  Yet I use touchscreen phones and know not why.  I love their look, their feel, their glow.  So maybe, after all, I really DO know.The Lumia 920 has been called a brick.  \"Excessive length, excessive thick\".  It is not featherweight nor thin.  Neither plasticky nor crackity nor prone to spin.Yet in my pants it loves to ride.  And in women\'s purses darkly hide.  But, oh!  the gasps when it\'s in sight.  Sexy lines and colors bright.Some swear there are no apps for it.  But owners know they\'re full of... spit.  How many, how much, can you install?  There\'s only so much time, after all.When I gave up keys, at first it hurted.  But now I am complete converted.  Adjust, adapt, adjust some more!  You too can be a touchscreen... connoisseur.So here I sit, a-fondly staring; touching, flicking, swiping, sharing.  Enjoying the little live tile show.  Feeding my info addiction, you know.I like.'),(347,'B009ZC91AY','I got this unlocked and it was working fine for a while. I was coming in from using a HTC Titan and I like Windows phone so it went well for a couple of months - until it starting acting weird.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUqH7No88mghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjtreGaaQUAthe screen basically gets a mind of its own sometimes and starts selecting/touching stuff on the display by itself. It started out pretty random - was typing a text message and it started to type gibberish. This went on and off for a while - until it completely bricked last night.I used to love Nokia- had a few of them while growing up but this is a huge disappointment. My old HTC Titan ran for 2 years without any major problems..:('),(348,'B009ZC91AY','What Can I say, I am fairly impressed with the latest version of Nokia\'s offering, its Crisp and there is no lag in the OS whatsoever, the features are endless and I was lucky enough to get a charging pad which does work and I see little difference in wired charging and wireless charging which is just as fast. Another thing the super sensitive screen works with gloves when turned on just as Nokia states, The screen is 4.5 inches and has more pixels per inch than the iPhone 5. As for the camera, it is perfect if you are in a pitch dark surrounding as it captures a lot of details with low levels of light and with even flash off. In other situations it takes better pictures of everything than my digital camera which is about a year old, however I have seen the iPhone 5 photographs on couple of my friends phones and the Nokia has a slight advantage as things are crisper, but it isn\'t a great difference as the other features, as all phones are getting better camera\'s. Finally the phone has Nokia\'s Killer apps for the phone such as Nokia Drive which can tell directions even when off line if you download maps, and Nokia city lens does create a useful augmented reality by pointing out businesses and sights through the phones camera. All of this is only $99 at At&t with a contract and even better only $450 without one, so you definitely get more for your money.'),(349,'B00A5TWFN6','It\'s much better than what I had expected. The phone\'s screen is big and seems very sturdy. I really like the tiles concept of the windows phone. The big screen really helps my aging eyes. The phone takes good photos day and night as well. Setting up e-mail is easy.However, there are some cons:1. The camera button is either extremely hard to press or the response time is too slow. I just can\'t get a handle on whether the picture was actually taken or not. I look later to find that some photos weren\'t taken because of the inconsistent button.2. The \'Bing\' tab on the lower right hand side of the screen seems so sensitive that even the slightest touch, brings up a new Bing screen for searching the net. Just wish this button was for the camera instead (at least I wouldn\'t miss shots)3. Once your directed to a new internet page, i.e. via  facebook or other applications, you can\'t get back to that particular application unless you exit and tap the application anew. - i.e. you can\'t get back to the spot in facebook that launched the internet page. You start reading again from the top!As for quality of materials and hardware, It\'s a very good phone altogether.'),(350,'B00A5TWFN6','I called AT&T; because when I put my SIM card in the phone, it said that it had to be unlocked. I thought it WAS FACTORY unlocked.  AT&T; told me they were so very sorry that my phone was actually owned by two previous owners & I had to give them both prior owners information in order to apply to them to unlock the phone.The phone was in a sealed box, all items were in plastic baggies (sealed). The phone had a sticker on the front of it.  BUT it had scratches on the back.  They weren\'t bad.  I liked the phone enough that I was going to keep it if it worked.  Well... It did not work!  AT&T; said they could not help.  I returned the phone to Amazon.com.  Thank God -- and many blessings to Amazon.com!  I went to TMobile and got a Nokia 925 from them. It is $20 off online right now. With the plan it cost me $480. I had to pay taxes and a small shipping fee. Not a problem.  My payments on my plan and phone will be the same as my old plan ($5 less actually).  I\'m happy with TMobile and Amazon... but not the JERKS from Tablet Distributors! Be careful out there people! There was no warranty either, so with 2 other owners, it was a sure bet there was something wrong with the phone. I\'ll never try something like that again! BUT the nice little case I got from Amazon.com won\'t work with the 925 either.Phone said I had 10 tries to get the unlock code right or the phone would lock up & become unusable.  Like I said earlier.  I thought it was already unlocked.  I\'ll tell you thought, AT&T; was SUPER nice!  They did go above and beyond trying to help me.  The lady was really sad for me as well -- and genuinely.'),(351,'B00A5TWFN6','I would recommend the product but not the vendor. The advertised product is not what they have delivered. The say RM-821 that is the factory unlocked version and send AT&T; unlocked phone, that is RM-820 working at different LTE band. On top of that, this product is not new. It came with small scratches, looks like it was used for demo, or by someone before. It is unbelievable.Beside that, Lumia 920 is a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone that likes Windowsphone platform. It does not relate to what it does, but how it does. It is very efficient.'),(352,'B00AGPWSNQ','The Nokia Lumia 920 Windows 8 phone is a frustration for you at first, if you have been used to working with a Windows desktop or laptop.  In my case I have used to working with a Windows 7 laptop. As a Windows user for years thru many versions, one thing that has always been consistent, is how you could logically store your files under folders with sub-folders, not with this Windows 8 phone.  DO NOT copy your folders over to this phone or it will never find it. Copy only the file document you want over to the Documents folder on the phone.  This has solved my dilemma for opening DOC, XLS, and PDF files, however the same procedure did not resolve my problem with OneNote files.  So I still need to find a solution for it.  This means you will not be able to store your files in an orderly manner as you may have been used with other windows devices.  This means means that 32 GB is way over-kill for phone memory if you are going to use the phone as a compact computer for business purposes and not wanting to carry around a bunch of music and games.  Who wants to have a lot of work documents on their phone without being able structurally store it. I just stumbled upon this fix for these documents by experimentation. When you Google for a fix to being able to find your documents on this phone, there are a lot of people having this same problem with no answers on the fix.I hope this has been helpful.My only hope is that Microsoft decides to make this phone more functional for a serious business user and provide an app to resolve this problem.'),(353,'B00AOIYZUO','My dad and I ordered the exact same phones. Mine came from this specific site, and his was a black one, but they were both by Nokia. His came manufactured incorrectly, the input for the charger is reversed on the inside, and there is no way you can stick the charger in to fit. Though I understand his phone was not from here, mine was. And mine showed up, and it looked used. There were a few scratches on the screen, and there was a chip, scratch or whatever you want to call it on the bottom left corner, as if it had been dropped. We are both sending our phones back, but we are going to try and re-order them for better results. I hope to make another review, hopefully a positive one.'),(354,'B00AOIYZUO','This phone has been reviewed thoroughly elsewhere. It is an excellent device, the flagship of the Windows Phone 8 line. I wanted to mention that the Cyan Lumia 920 I ordered from this page came glossy, not matte. If you\'re familiar with AT&T\'s Lumia 920 line, the black and cyan models are matte, and the red/white/yellow models are glossy. Why then did I receive a glossy Cyan Lumia 920? I\'m not sure. I do know that the box that it came in was a counterfeit copy of the one that comes with the local AT&T version. The charger, manual and SIM card ejector are different, too. The phone itself otherwise seems authentic, but one curious thing did happen when I powered it on. The default color for the interface was red, not blue. Anyone who has purchased a Lumia 920 through AT&T knows that the default color scheme matches the color of the phone. So, apparently, I have a Glossy Blue phone that thinks it\'s a Red phone. The only thing that I can figure is that either this is a refurbished unit with a new glossy blue casing, or the software was set incorrectly. I\'m not dissatisfied, though. The phone works as well as any other Lumia 920 I\'ve owned, and I actually kind of prefer the glossy finish. I always wanted the (relatively rare) cyan color, and now I have it.'),(355,'B00AR23T5O','I\'ve had my share of phones, both the super popular and the underdogs.After being tired of Apple and getting rid of every Apple device I owned, the last one was the phone, because I was really comfortable with iOS, but it was starting to get slow and annoying. After much thought and going through a lot of Android phones, I decided to take the plunge again on the underdog, Windows Phone.I\'ve got to say I cannot be happier with my decision: Windows Phone is everything a mobile device operating system SHOULD BE. iOS is nice, Android is a bit hit and miss, but Windows Phone just NAILS IT. The experience is smooth and very well thought out, and I love the fact that online and offline makes no sense anymore. Wanna see your photos/ The phone will show you, indistinctly, the ones saved in your phone and those of your online accounts, seamlessly. Wanna contact someone? The People hub is just a godsend. Everything is integrated. It\'s just wonderful. And it runs really fast.Now this phone, even though it\'s a bit old now, still holds quite a punch against its newer counterparts. I mean, the 925 is an afterthought, not even worth the upgrade, only the 930 coming out soon will be quite superior in many terms.The main reasons I got this phone for were the camera and the maps. Both are incredibly good and I made the right decision. The camera is excellent and with fast operation, and you can tweak pretty much EVERY PARAMETER there is to get that perfect shot. Exposure time, aperture, ISO level, white balance, it\'s all there at your fingertips if you decide to go manual. On automatic modes, the camera does a pretty good job of guessing the best conditions (Although it can get confused with white balance some times).The maps take the cake. They are comprehensive and work offline just perfectly. Real lifesavers when you go on a trip and don\'t have data accounts. They have gotten me around in many places and I am totally in love. The driving directions are spot on and the transit directions are excellent too. I thought I\'d miss Google Maps, but honestly, no way I do.People usually say against WP that the app support is poor. Admittedly, apps are in lower number here, but most of the popular ones are available, and personally I am not a fan of gaming on my phone so I don\'t pay attention to that, but there sure are more games on iOS or Android. But things are starting to catch up and I see more and more games coming up and they are just as good as in the other OS versions, so if WP picks up momentum as I expect it too, this won\'t be a problem anymore.App wise the worse thing that happened here is the Facebook app. Facebook has not done an official app and the one made by Microsoft is OK but no cigar. It has a lot of problems and many features that don\'t work. It makes for a generally poor FB experience. I usually rather see my updates and upload photos and update status to FB using the Windows Phone system itself, because it\'s faster and more intuitive! Another plus point for the operating system.In all, this device is just beautiful, great quality, with a kicking camera and maps application, and with an operating system that puts the others to shame. I must definitely recommend this phone to anyone thinking of taking the plunge into Windows Phone, although at this time it may be better to perhaps wait for the Lumia 930. But if you are on a budget, the price of this one is plummeting and it\'s a GREAT phone to own.'),(356,'B00AR23T5O','Nokia needs to add some assembly required. The SIM card slot comes with the package, not installed in the phone. It is not a big deal and it is simple to install, even if you think you cannot install it you can, even if you refuse to install it your service provider will install it. The card slot takes 5 - 10 seconds to install; however the problem is this:When you purchase this type of phone it is never purchased by itself. There are screen protectors and cases that go with it. In general people do not read instruction manuals for phones, unless of course there is a message of some assembly required.Other than the card slot, this is an incredible phone. The apps are growing every day, between Nokia, Microsoft, and AT&T; (my service provider) I have 3 industry leading companies providing me service. Here is the bottom line even with is type of OS in it\'s infancy google will never beat Microsoft, Nokia has been an industry standard since inception and as for Bell laboratories they have an incredible track record for engineering and innovation. When you buy technology you go with leaders not imitators.'),(357,'B00AR23T5O','So I\'ve had MANY phones.  in a 3 year time, since drowning my second iPhone, I\'ve had 4 Android phones.(Nexus phones are the best on the Android platform...but this is my second Nokia.I tried the Lumia 900 but the OS and app ecosystem was still to young, so I went back to Android for another year and a half.After almost 2 years I felt it was time to retire my Galaxy Nexus so I began doing a lot research.  I found the Nokia 920 was getting great reviews and almost every app I used on the Android platform was available on the WP8 platform now (only missing app is Nest but that works on the browser anyway).I\'ve had this phone for about 2 weeks now and I love this phone!  The camera is outstanding! The wireless charging ROCKS and it just works...Even with iTunes when you download the WP8 app.  I recommend you purchase the Nokia case because even the matte polycarbonate case is a little to slick.  You won\'t be disappointed with your purchase.'),(358,'B00AR23T5O','The manufacture quality of this phone is good. However, it has an obvious design flaw, which results in nonfunctional proximity sensor. This seems to be a fairly common problem when I looked up in the web.Also the front camera somehow accumulates dust from inside. Now I can barely use the front camera anymore.However the customer service is good in my opinion. Nokia offers shipping to ship my phone for repair/replacement.Besides these issues the phone is ok. Fast, but has limited apps (well this is MS\'s problem not the phone\'s).'),(359,'B00AR23T5O','I\'m going to start by saying that I\'ve tried to get a hold of this phone for months but haven\'t had the chance until now. I got mine from Mobicity. The phone came in dutch, but I was quickly able to switch it to english by using the google translator and selecting the right options. I configured the phone--amazingly, the Windows 8 tablet I have doesn\'t support POP accounts, but the phone does--had to migrate my contacts to the hotmail account to get them on the phone.I used to be a blackberry user, and it was a little painfull to switch and migrate the data. Windows Phone 8 consolidates all accounts and contacts in the people tile and it takes some time to get used to this. I use whatsapp for chatting and there are some options in blackberry that are not found in the Windows Phone version, such as adding a number to an existing contact. One thing that I trying to do with it is change the tile\'s color, not all of them but individually. For example, I have 4 email accounts and I would like to differentiate one from the others, but tiles can all change from color not individually.Another thing is that the volume buttons control all volumes at the same time, including ring, speaker, notifications, alarms, etc.Still, this phone rocks. When I take it to meetings, people stare a it. It takes the best pictures with low light I\'ve ever seen. The grip is a little slippery. It has gotten away from my hands on 2 ocassions already and I\'m actively looking for a cover.Office experience is great, gravity sensor is a little slow as it needs the phone to be at a given angle before it will tilt the screen.'),(360,'B00AR23T5O','This phone feels good in my hand, is beautiful to look at, has great call clarity, has a decent battery life, and does whatever I want it to do quickly and elegantly. The camera is also quite good, though not as good as I hoped. It outperforms my Lumix pocket camera, but photos aren\'t as beautiful as my old olympus pocket camera. However, overall, it does everything well and I\'m completely satisfied.Switching from Android to Windows Phone was seamless and refreshing. I have no desire to ever return to using an Android phone.The only problem is that the audio output when using headphones is iffy ... sometimes I only get audio in one ear. Since I barely listen to music, this isn\'t a big deal for me, but I imagine for others it would be a deal breaker. I imagine if you bought it at a reputable reseller, you could return it due to the audio jack problem, but for me, it isn\'t worth it.'),(361,'B00AR23T5O','I have had Apple products from day one.  I was in line for every phone including the 5.  I have been locked into ATT of course and the billing is super high/expensive and difficult to control.

It was horrible, the batter lasted 2 hours max, the OS and Android Apps were ugly, difficult and buggy.  What a mess.  I sold it after great frustration and hardware issues.  I purchased this International Un-locked version of the Nokia 920.  Wow.  Windows OS is awesome, flawless, fast, fun and live.  The set up is intuitive, and Apple can\'t beat the integrated, speedy sexy look and operation.  This is an awesome product.  I know there are thinner and even more sleek Nokia and other Window phones out there now, but I have this one and I am sold.  My iPhone has less than a year and it will be buried next to my Newton.

It is an AT&T phone, the box was previously opened, the screen protector was clearly placed back on the phone, and it had apps already installed on it (unless ESPN and The Weather Channel apps are default apps, which I doubt).  Bottom line, I will keep it for now, because I need a phone, but if I am getting a used or refurbed phone, I should not be paying the \"new\" phone price.  I feel like I am being scammed and it makes me seriously reconsider using Amazon for such purchases.'),(365,'B00AR23T5O','I bought this phone from HeavyDuty Electronics. The phone only worked for 4.5 months. I found out the supplier and Amazon are selling phones with NO US warranty. I filed a claim and please see the answer from the supplier:This device, the RM-821, is the international version. It has a warranty through the country in which it was manufactured. Please contact Nokia and they should be able to point you in the right direction. More likely than not, it will be coming from Nokia UK, Nokia Dubai, or Nokia Hong Kong.Please let me know if you have any questions.Thanks,Ronnie V.So, I have to contact Nokia to find out where the phone was manufactured.!!! This is absurd.Dont trust this supplier.'),(366,'B00AR23T5O','So it has been about 6 months since I recklessly abandoned my Apple iPhone 3GS (ok, so maybe it wasn\'t such a reckless abandonment). I feel that now I can offer you a sound review steeped in experience. But let\'s keep this simple, shall we?PROSLOVE the huge, clear, colorful screen! I like to play games, and not just the Angry Birds variety, and this is the screen for that!Camera is nothing short of awesome. I can zoom in and out, have flash (which is also a neat flashlight if you download the app), and video capability.Apps are generous and there are a significant number of free apps and I have yet to be bored using new apps but, (see CONS)Windows platform feels &#34;familiar&#34; and honestly it did not feel like a huge departure from the iPhone if you are wary of a switch.CONSAs the screen is huge, so is the device itself. It is &#34;chunky&#34; and feels like a dish-plate is against your face when using it as a phone. My resolution was either to use speakerphone which is loud and clear, or use the ear-buds and microphone I got the last time I dropped my old phone (I was pleasantly surprised that it worked so well with the Nokia). Perhaps a plus here is that it is a solid phone as evidenced by multiple drops with no visual or functional issues, and that in itself is a &#34;pro&#34;.Though the camera itself takes great photos etc., a flaw to me is that it is challenging to navigate to the camera. Yes, you can click the camera button on the side and go immediately to the take a picture mode, but when you take the shot and want to review it is several steps to do so. Same thing if trying to snap a photo from, say, the texting box. Seems like it should be easier.I mention here again the Apps Marketplace. There are a lot of novel, fun, articulate apps for the Windows phone, however, the apps that &#34;everyone has&#34;, or even the one that you want for your bank, for example, or EasyShift or whatever, it\'s not available for this phone. It\'s a small but annoying thing that and hopefully folks developing apps will begin to identify the Windows platform phones as a focus for development. Though a &#34;small&#34; thing it warrants the 4 versus the 5 star review.So that\'s about it at this point. I do want to note that this review has not mentioned the buying or selling process here at all as I did not purchase the phone with this seller.Thanks and enjoy!'),(367,'B00AR23T5O','The internet reviews for this phone looked really good and so as my Blackberry was dying I decided to purchase one. Firstly it did not arrive by the guaranteed shipping date. It arrived 5 days later. I originally had it shipped to a friend\'s house but because it arrived 5 days late, he had left the country. So we had to convince the FedEx guy to allow the neighbour to sign for it then ship it to a new address, which had an additional cost attached to it. When I finally got the phone and opened it up, the manual was missing from the box - maybe it was a used phone. When I finally loaded my SIM card and made the first call I realized the microphone was not working. Anyone interested in purchasing this phone, search for forums about &#34;microphone not working in Lumia 920&#34; on the internet. Unfortunately I did not pick up on this earlier, the microphone has a noise reduction feature which sometimes cancels out your voice completely so the person on the other end does not hear you at all. Sure it works fine on speaker and videocam because that uses a different microphone. Apparently it is a design flaw in the Lumia 920 and Nokia doesn\'t seem to be doing anything about it. All those fancy features yet the basic thing a phone is supposed to be able to do is allow you to make and receive calls and the Lumia 920 is incapable of doing that. What a waste of money! Disappointed!'),(368,'B00AR23T5O','Well I got the phone in one piece and it works. HOWEVER I ordered a international unlocked phone, at least that\'s what I thought i was clicking purchase from. The phone was sold by BREED. What came was a AT & T branded unlocked phone. While the phone is truly unlocked, since I live in Jamaica I don\'t use AT&T and find the AT&T logo on phone and the logo on screen that pops up on restart annoying and a painful reminder that I didn\'t get what I feel I paid for. However phone works otherwise, up to the point of theis post.'),(369,'B00AR23T5O','The Lumia 920 is a solid device. The built quality is amazing, and it feels like a tank. Is heavier than most average smartphone (or even some phablets), but when holding it, you know it can\'t be broken easily.The interface is fluid and fresh, although the customization options are limited to tile size and color.Pros:- Camera: the best smartphone camera I have seen in my life- Nokia apps and services: Specially Maps (Nokia Here) and camera-realated apps.- Windows Phone Marketplace: Many people complains about lack of apps. I found everything I need (mostly free and with no ads).Cons:- No LED notification: coming from BB, this is something I really miss, and I don\'t know why this is a missing feature on almost every modern smartphone.- Battery: It charges slow (very slow), and discharges fast (really fast). It took 3 hours to charge from 60% to 100% with a 2 amp wall charger. The discharge rate is more than 10% per hour (with regular use, no automatic backups/updates, low level screen brightness and only 2 backgroud apps running), so I cannot get more than 10 hours of juice.- WP8 still feels a little half-baked. Hopefully MS fixes some glitches in the upcoming updates. For example, inhability to close tasks more efficiently, the &#34;search&#34; soft button takes me to Bing, instead of search stuff inside the device, etc.Also, I must say that the seller (Heavy Duty Electronics) gave me an excellent service. The device was exactly as advertised and came in a sealed box, 100% brand new, and factory unlocked.'),(370,'B00AR23T5O','To begin I read about all the negative experiences with getting the right product.  I did get the expected product...brand new and international. (Ordered from FGS Trading) The only hitch was it was definitely packaged for the European market as it arrived with a charging plug for the European use.  I am in Canada.  I have multiple 3.5 mm chargers so no biggie.Now on the phone. I first powered it on and had to change the language to English.  Took all of 30 seconds.  Holding the phone is a treat.  To people who find this phone heavy.  You should be concerned with the strength in your hands let alone the weight of this phone.  This phone is meant be used with a slim case if any.  It is extremely durable and you can feel the quality it it.  To put it in perspective the famed iPhone 5 is 220 grams when adding on the very popular Otterbox Defender case.  This phone weighs in at 185 grams.  With my Nokia case (17 gms) it is 202 gms total.  This makes that particular iPhone 5 and defender combo wider and heavier.  You will rarely see people put this phone in a case.  In fact there are not many cases made for this phone...maybe for that reason.  Corning Gorilla Glass 2 also adds to this durability.It is definitely a looker.  From front to back it just looks the business.  I got the black matte to limit any possibilities and fingerprints and it just looks good.  Colors are more likely to leave scratches as you can see with the iPhone 5c.  They have the same case.  Funny how apple has to make the iPhone 5c look so similar to that of Nokia colored phones but we will leave that topic alone.The fluidity of the phone is great... and simple.  No clutter to report.  I like having the ability to only have what I want on my home screen with the live tiles.  All other apps are easily reached but tucked away.  The camera of course is one of the most respected cameras on the market as Nokia is arguably the best on the market -  the Lumia 1020 has taken away the steam of the 920 but it is still fantastic.  I have used it for a month and my wife\'s iPhone does not compare.  The screen is very good...uses the same technology as the iPhone 5s (IPS LCD)I really feel the app bashing windows gets is blown way out of proportion. Reason being is there are a lot of useful apps and its not cluttered with pointless ones (Something I experienced a lot with my Blackberry Z10 on blackberry world).  I have found almost all the apps I would ever need.  The third party counterparts are great unlike in blackberry world.  I personally prefer quality over quantity.  I really enjoy all the in house apps Nokia makes.  Nokia MixRadio is fantastic as is their Camera app. Nokia Maps is very good and on par with Google Maps.  Nokia makes so many of their own apps I find I am not needing to find the third party apps to use ad I prefer that as well.The only things I could think of that I feel could be improved upon is the lack notifications and the Windows keypad is not quite as up to par as the Blackberry10\'s (nothing comes close...including Apple and Android)  Those are very minor issues and can be addressed with software updates.Anyone who says they are disappointed with this phone is weak handed and never gave it a chance and probably came from using an iPhone or Google and look at APP numbers.  The Apps are coming.  Apple has had 10 years to build up its app market...Windows is on 3.  Its the experience I was after.  I could afford an iPhone or an S4 but went with the Lumia.  There is something about Windows 8 that is refreshing.  Live tiles is a great concept that has potential to be more and who knows what will come with Windows Phone 8.1 update which is coming soon. That\'s my rant.  If you like having the phone everyone else has stick to your iPhone.  If you like to brag about specs get a top flight Android.  If you prefer to have a lightweight operating system that just feels right...try a Lumia 920,1020 or above.'),(371,'B00AR23T5O','When received I thought the phone was damaged, It did not turn on, after several attempts connecting the charger and disconnecting it, the phone finally turned ON, it seemed the battery was completely discharged and when it is hot and completely discharged it needs some time (hour or more) to cool down before connecting the charger. After a couple of months using it, it has performed well. 1 con is that this phone seemed to have been locked for AT&T; previously, and though it was unlocked I had some problem trying to use internet sharing (tethering), A message popped up telling me to get an unlock code from AT&T;, after a long search on the web I found a procedure to make it work with other mobile operators.As nokia lumia is promised, the screen has not been scratched, and I don\'t use a screen protector, really amazing !!!'),(372,'B00AR23T5O','This phone is by far the best I have ever own.Build like a brick, feels solid and reliable in my hands, and being a big phone is incredibly comfortable to use. This is real hardware!!! It was obviously designed and engendered to stand heavy use.The built in camera is really good. It won&#8217;t replace my DSLR but for snapshots and street photography is more than enough.Windows OS is truly smooth and fulfill all my needs.The app store may not have two or three millions of apps but truly, who cares?Whatsapp, facebook a weather forecast and a stock quote app is all I need.Of course these are only my requirements and other users may require apps not yet available in windows sore.Including Office and OneNote is a great plus. Please note that you can only create word and excel documents.What to improve: IMO the unlock button is misplaced and would be far more comfortable in a place easy reachable with the thumb.'),(373,'B00AR23T5O','My mother has a Lumia 800 and it has always worked very well. When all others have only 2-3 bars of signals, she always has full. Then I was determined to switch back to old Nolia brand. I purchased this Lumia 920, the design and picture quality did impress me. The seller was BREED, and i have got AT&T unlocked instead of factory unlocked. As in all other AT&T unlocked phones, this one has a bunch of AT&T applications that are not useful when I am with T-Mobile. This itself did not bother me a lot until I inserted my T-Mobile SIM card, it said my SIM card was invalid. I started to worry and called both the seller and Nokia, there was no effective advices given by them other than suggesting to return it because they suspected the SIM card reader was not functioning. I thought about it and wanted to give it a last try --- I shut down and restarted the Windows, and it did work out. So this is the catch: you need to restart the phone in order for the SIM card switch to work, while with many other phones this step is not necessary.  The battery was very good and hold up for 3+ days for standby and regular calls/sms. But it ran out very quickly just in a matter of a few hours if I used any map application even for just a few minutes.  I actually turned off location service (GPS) and I switched away from map application right after, but the battery still draining super-fast no matter I put it one Battery Saver\'s mode or not, unless I restart the phone. I experienced in a few occasions that the connection was lost, but it was because my calls were dropped twice in a library that has average connections that I decided enough is enough -  I need to return this phone. I still believe Nokia could make the best phones and this unique experience might just happen to me individually.'),(374,'B00AR23T5O','Bought my Nokia Lumia 920 on Oct 15 2013. It was working fine for the first 2 months. Occasionally there would be signal coverage problems but I thought it was something to do with the Network provider. But then after 2 months, I started experiencing major problems with the phone. The display would flicker & the display got all grainy. Network signal coverage started getting hit badly. There was no physical damage to the phone, meaning the phone was NOT dropped in ground or water or any liquid for that matter. One fine day, it was totally gone. It wouldn\'t simply start.On taking it to a Nokia customer care center, It was informed that this was a manufacturer defect and it was something to do with its hardware & software. Poooofff... I thought there goes my $350 :(But fortunately I contacted Amazon after 3 months of purchase and explained them the problems. They were kind enough to listen to my problems and accepted a return after the warranty & gave me a refund.Here is my Verdict:For Nokia Lumia 920:Pros:1. Photo quality is good.2. Speaker volume is good.3. Sturdy buildCons:1. Very Unstable Hardware & Software with Windows OS.2. Lot of problems/bug with the phone.3.

No scratches yet, battery life did feel short some time ago but after software updating that is no longer a problem, screen definition Is great, as well as sound output quality, all I can say is I\'m really glad I decided to buy Nokia and would buy nokia again if I ever have the need to change my smartphone, I\'m very satisfied with this phone.'),(376,'B00AR23T5O','I tried using a few different Windows Phone 8 devices a few months back (Lumia 620, Lumia 820, Lumia 810) and they were good phones, but they were either buggy or too slow. Choppy audio, duplicate music files, poor music file tagging, unplayable podcast files from the Store, and buggy SD card support plagued all of them.Some of these items remain with the Lumia 920, but this must have an updated version of the OS, because things are improved. Audio no longer stutters and there are no problems with duplicate music files. Music file tagging is still broken, especially album and artist artwork, but I was able to fix most of the artwork via the MPATool app. The Xbox Music connection option does not fix any of this. It\'s actually sad that Microsoft\'s built-in music solution is such a huge step back from WP7, and it remains as my biggest complaint about WP8. Microsoft seems to want you to use their online Xbox Music service instead of CD rips.Podcast files from the Store play perfectly. However, you cannot manually add podcast files to your phone and have them show up in your Podcast section. If you manually add podcast files to your phone, they will show up in the Music section, which is strange. Sorting options are not as varied as it was in WP7.This is one of the few WP8 devices that has 32 gigs of storage, which is great for a guy like me who stores his entire music collection on the phone, and I download a lot of Podcasts. It\'s a shame more phones don\'t come with this much storage. I picked a phone with this amount of storage to avoid using a micro SD card.I bought an unlocked version so I can use my T-Mobile sim card. As of August 28, 2013, the phone has not received the GDR2 \"Amber\" update, which is a shame. Nokia\'s website says it\'s still in testing, so hopefully this phone will get it soon.Of all of the WP8 devices I have used, this one offers the best experience. The OS has some flaws when it comes to the way it handles media, but you can work around them for the most part. The rest of the OS is exceptional. It\'s slick, pretty, and has plenty of applications. The live tiles are really cool and give the OS a unique look and feel.The hardware is great. The screen is big and beautiful. The 1280x768 screen is crisp and clear. The phone is rectangular, but with curved edges. It\'s almost too big to be a pocket phone, but not quite. The 1.5 GHz dual core CPU makes for a very smooth user experience. Compared to my old Samsung Focus, all applications and games are noticeably faster.If this model received quicker OS updates, it would be a serious contender for the top WP8 device. As is, it\'s still an excellent phone.'),(377,'B00AR23T5O','There are a lot of comments on how people receive defected phones, I was aware of that...so I contact the seller, spent extra money just to ensure I get the right phone.Seller &#34;Hanssel Free Cell&#34; claimed that the phone is 1.new 2.sealed 3.having no carrier logos 4. and unlocked.1. The phone isn\'t new, it has been opened (sticker seal broke, for a &#34;long time&#34; already)! And everything is in Arabic or some other languages. And the scary thing is that there are already some apps on there, I suspect that the phone is not new and perhaps used, and plus, the phone has zero juice, which I charged a half hour just to get it turned on.2. The phone is not sealed, not as what seller told me on the e-mail.3. The phone does not have carrier logos on it, I truly appreciate that.4. The phone is unlock, by far, I think.There are so many sellers that are selling this phone, many at even cheaper prices, I bought it under false advertisement, I need an explanation.'),(378,'B00AZMP44A','Visually attractive (the hardware and the software), really different to the other mobile devices, works incredibly fast, no lags at all... IE10 was a surprise I didn\'t expected. May be the best thing is the screen, good resolution and looks great down the sun light. At the same time, the automatic brightness performs in effective and unnoticeable fashion. Responsive tactile panel... The camera, even not the best, is very good for the price tag and the battery duration is more or less like the other devices (one day and half).The only bad thing is the the app store is not nourished as Windows Phone competitors are, and normally WP is the last platform to get updates from the most popular applications.'),(379,'B00AZMP44A','I purchased this phone from another venue. While I love the phone, you have to buy a GSM micro SIM card that will connect in your area. There are only two GSM carriers in the US, AT& T and T-Mobile (which uses AT & T if not in a T-Mobile area). There are a lot of GSM SIM cards on the market, but all of them require connecting to one of these two networks in the US.Unfortunately, my home town is locked down to only two carriers, there is no AT& T service here, and while T-Mobile advertises 2G voice in my area, in reality it doesn\'t exist. The phone works great in a town 20 miles away with T-Mobile. Just make absolutely sure your service area can access the two networks. If you live in a major city you\'ll be fine. One small plus is you can use the phone with WiFi and use Skype if you\'re stuck without service.'),(380,'B00AZMP44A','I\'ve been using this phone since June 2013 and it works perfectly fine since! All the features works and the touchscreen is very responsive, although, I suggest you buy a screen protector if you don\'t want to get any stratches on there. The only downside I see to this phone is the thickness of it and removing the back panel is a bit testing as you have to apply some force to your camera/led flash. Being a mid-range smartphone, a plus is that it features NFC capabilities. The battery life for this phone is also amazing (compared to other rivals at the same price range).

The build quality of the phone is very good, exceeding my expectation for this price range. The back cover is plastic but the color (yellow) with some transparency makes it look fun and fresh.

Good resolution and color.A plus side is that this phone allows you to change battery. The back cover comes off just like the good old times of the not-so-smart-phones.Software wise, the OS and the standard apps feel responsive and easy to use. Buying Nokia will give you access to a bunch of interesting apps. Windows Phone is still lacking in terms of apps, but it have most of the apps that I intent to use so that\'s okay for me.If you want a good phone for a great price, this is it. If you want to latest and greatest, look elsewhere.'),(382,'B00B1O15C6','First, a little background, for perspective: I\'m an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to Android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the OS. I\'ve really liked the Android OS and the phones I\'ve bought along the way. A few months ago I bought a Lumia 521 with a new Metro PCS account. The Lumia 521 introduced me to Windows 8 Phone OS and I was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and FUN it is - so I decided to fork out for a premium Windows Phone ... which is what brought me to the Lumia 820.The NOKIA LUMIA 820 is SOLID. It\'s heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. The display is vibrant and beautiful. Reviewers and \"experts\" out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is BEAUTIFUL. Colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!As was the case with my (brief) experience on the Lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, FAST. Every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. There\'s something about this Windows OS that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile OS\'s, because things just pop and fly all over the place.The Tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing OS Interface. You see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the \"People\" tile ... Facebook posts of friends \"pop up\" in live time, as they are happening ... News updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your Songza app suddenly flips over to say \"It is Friday Night\" (or late Saturday morning, etc.) ... the Photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!More on Tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). You can even Pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it\'s own. I\'ve got four favorite Playlists (from Nokia Music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music \"block\", the size of a regular tile!The Lumia 820 has NFC capability and Wireless Charging - something I didn\'t think I\'d ever need or use, but I did fork out for the charging plate and it\'s been a very nice bonus. I\'ve already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it\'s back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.CUSTOMIZATION!  Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I\'ve since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928?  Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It\'s smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares?  When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the \"expert\" opinions from the tech sites). None of it matters.Apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the Windows app store and it\'s \"horrible dearth of apps\". If you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they\'ve got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. I don\'t know WHO these people are, or WHAT they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the Windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... I feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). Sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?The 8GB of internal space ... once the OS requirements are subtracted, you\'ve got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. Unlike it\'s bigger brethren in the Lumia family, this one comes with a Micro SD slot. I\'ve got a 32GB card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). That should hold me for awhile.The Camera ... with Carl Zeiss optics and Dual LED Flash,  the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. I\'ve also loaded an HDR app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. I\'ve been taking photos for Instagram, Foodspotting, Facebook and Twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. I have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to Skydrive, so I\'ve got an instant backup of everything I\'ve taken.I\'m not going to spend any time hashing-out or \"reviewing\" technical details, you\'ll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites). Suffice it to say, this is one of the best and THE most enjoyable phone I\'ve ever owned.'),(383,'B00B1O15C6','I\'ve been using a small Sony Xperia X8(android) for 2 years so I decided to give this Nokia a try.I\'ve always been pro-Windows so I decided to buy this phone because it was now cheap, even though it was released like 2 years ago.I bought it Unblocked on April 2014, from ABCellPROS:-  Overall quality is very good.  Nokia never lets me down.-  Wireless tethering(Internet sharing) thats good!!-  I can choose to navigate pages as a desktop browser and not as a mobile browser which has some restrictions by some sites.-  It has mini versions of Word and Excel included.-  The main icons screen is very easy to use and to manage.-  Video playback is smooth and looks good.-  The file structure of the SD card is very simple, not like Androids which is filled with dozens of folders.CONS:-  The battery life is bad, but since mine is a used one I can not say if the new ones are better.-  Not so good MP3 player.  Too confusing.  I just needed a simple player.-  Bad MP3s codecs, could not play some of my 320Kbps songs, like my Sony Xperia X8 did easily.  However an app called Pocket File Manager did play these songs well, I did not expect that from a file management app.-  The flashlight is not full white, it has like some kind of warmth in it, so some photos might look warm(yellowish).-  One of the three main buttons is dedicated entirely to Bing search.  I don\'t like Bing, so for me it is a big waste of a button that could have been useful for any other function.-  Very grainy photos in low light when flash is not used.-  On the internet browser, part of the screen (like 15% I guess) is wasted displaying the URL the whole time.-  No &#34;forward&#34; button or feature on the internet browser.FINAL THOUGHTS:Even though the phone has almost everything I need, it always leaves me the feeling that I\'m isolated( or imcomtible) from the Android population.  The grass is greener....Unless Microsoft make some huge improvements on these phones in the near future, I think that I\'ll eventually go back to Android sooner or later.'),(384,'B00B1O15C6','I don\'t take a lot of pictures and I don\'t need my phone to work like my tablet.  I wanted a sturdy phone with expandable storage that ran the Windows OS.  That is what I got with this phone.  It\'s pretty much the perfect size for my hand, not too thick, but doesn\'t feel cheap.  That back pops off and the battery is removable, another plus that I wasn\'t even looking for.  The wireless charging cases are pretty cheap ($15 off at&t; website) so I\'ll be getting one of those soon, the charging plate is probably a little more expensive though.  A protective case fits right over the removable back and can reportedly be charged wirelessly through it.  (For those that don\'t know, the back of this phone is removable, that\'s where the wireless charging case goes.  A protective cover can go on top of that for even more durability).  The sound quality isn\'t the best I\'ve ever had, but then again I don\'t really like talking on the phone in the first place, so this gives me an excuse when my wife is chattering on and on and on.  And on and on.  And on again.  Hmm...I hope she never sees this review...Anywho, I digress....this phone is exactly what I was looking for.  Not too fancy, will most likely last me more than the 2-year contract that I\'m used to with smart phones.  I like it much better than my previous HTC Windows 8X which felt cheap and had only 8GB of memory.  Both are better than my previous Android phone as I much prefer the Windows OS.'),(385,'B00B1O15C6','First of all, I bought two Nokia L820 from Blutekusa (fulfillment by Amazon) as new factory unlocked  4G LTE penta bands: (800/900/1800/2100/2600 MHz), however I received  2 AT&T; unlocked Lumia 820 (Variant RM-824) which is a dual  band LTE (1700/700 MHz) with no standard accessories (Nokia AC-50U MicroUSB Charger, Nokia Charging and Data Cable (CA-190CD)) or earphones. I received a no brand generic Chinese charger that it is not able to remain attached to the cell phone during charging because of the weakness of its attachment clips at the micro usb connector. Everybody knows that AT&T; devices never come factory unlocked, they are exclusively manufactured for its network, so these Cells are not new they were refurbished to be unlocked. Moreover, I think that the back shell is not original because it arrived with a little dent in one of its corners and with no brand (Nokia/AT&T;) or parte number it is completely flat (inside and outside) and is so weak that I damaged a corner with the nail trying to remove the shell to install the battery. I was able to update the OS to WP Amber and it works really fast.As you can see on previous reviews Nokia L820 is a really good cell phone (a little giant but not excellent) with fluent WP8 but with really two big sins:  the 1650mAh Battery is too little for all things that you can do with this cell phone and the lacking of gorilla glass.'),(386,'B00B1O15C6','The WIndows OS is a pleasant surprise.  Very smooth and responsive.  The 820 is a great, underrated phone.  Although it is considered a mid-level phone, the specs are similar to the top of the line 920.  The biggest mid-level feature might be the camera - depends on how avid a photographer you are.  For general pictures it works wonderfully.  Considering the price/feature set, this phone is hard to beat.Highlights:Pros: Design (not too big); microSD; Carl Zeiss Lens and 8.7MP Camera; 1.5 GHz Snapdragon Processor; 1GB Ram; 4.3-inch AMOLED ScreenCons: Average Battery Life; No Image Stabilization'),(387,'B00B1O15C6','After trying out a Lumia 520, I decided to upgrade to a higher level WP8 phone.  I have been using my 520 as a media device with my primary phone being an Android.  Although the 920, 1020 and 1520 seem to be excellent devices, what made me go with an 820 is that while it may not be the best at any particular feature, it has all the features that I\'m looking for.  I have the AT&T; Deathstar version.1.  4G LTE2.  At least 1 GB RAM3.  Replaceable battery4.  MicroSD slot expandable to 64 GB.5.  AMOLED screen6.  Glance7.  Wireless charging with a shell8.

I love AMOLED\'s.  Glance is a great feature.  Call quality is good.  Fast web surfing.  It feels solid in the hand.  I think the 820 is currently the best all around WP8 phone.  WP8 is a good, smooth, lag free phone.  It\'ll be even better with the upgrade to 8.1.  Sound is great through headphones.  Speakerphone volume is decent.  The only downside is the relatively poor app store.  Very few Google apps, which I rely on.The battery life so far is good enough for me.  The camera, again, while not the latest Nokia masterpiece like the 41 MP on the 1020 or 20 MP on the Icon or 1520 takes decent pictures.For the money the phone is a 5/5.  Compared to other phones (high end included), it\'s more like a 4/5.Update 4/23/14: I updated the OS the WP8.1 Preview for Developers.  The phone is even more awesome with 3 columns, action center, and Cortana.  So far, it\'s running well with WP8.1.'),(388,'B00B1O15C6','i bought this phone as an upgrade from the Lumia 800. it runs very smooth and is responsive.all the apps i like to use are available. the camera and vid functions are also very nice you wont be dissapointed.one option i do like was the wireless charging covers. you remove your old cover and put this one on in its place.i had got a few different colors so i could change my phone theme from time to time.i was not going to buy the wireless option because i thought it was just a cover that you place over the phone. after i seen it was an actual body replacment i changed my mind. the covers look original not an extra hanging off the phone.I think its a great deal for a phone in the 200 to 300 dollar range. the functionality and options are worth twice that amount.'),(389,'B00B1O15C6','this is my intro to WP8 so everything is different.CONs- Nokia suit does not work with WP8 so i could not import my contacts. which means i now have to type them in 1 by 1. if i get a work around for this i\'ll post an update.- No FM Radio. the specs say radio but there\'s no radio. according to what I\'ve been reading Nokia\'s hardware will do radio but Windows drop the ball on the software. Some folks are hopeful that Windows will make an update to fix that but this phone has been out long enough for them to have fixed this by now so i don\'t think its a priority for them. Surprisingly i got a streaming radio app from the windows store (tunein) and it has my local stations. Suppressing because i\'m from St. Lucia (in the Caribbean) where no one heard of. so if my local stations are there yours probably is too. the problem with this is you need wifi for this, which means the quality is poor depending on your connection and if i had to use a data plan for this it would get too expensive for free radio.- SD card slot is under the battery. my thoughts are that an SD memory card should have quick access without having to turn your phone off. With this phone you have to turn the phone, remove the cover and battery to get to the card.- the battery life is exactly as many reviews say. it sucks. i have to charge this phone EVERYDAY. if you get this phone my advise is to get extra chargers; have one at work, at home, in the car, at moms house... cause you\'ll need it. the good thing is the phone does not take long to charge. but truth be told most smart phones today have this issue. You have to keep them plugged in (and that does not hurt the battery by-the-way).i know i went on a bit about the radio and nokia suit thing but those were selling points for me. i first gave this 2 stars because of this but i reconsidered because the phone is a good phone. if you\'re going to advertise something and not deliver that will not make me buy from you in the future. Nokia suit was a big selling point for me because i have hundreds of contacts and having to re-enter them 1 by 1 every time i get a new phone is a pain. for this alone i no longer have any reason to have any brand loyalty to Nokia.if i could push myself past these 2 sticking points, i actually like this phone. its not as big as the GS3. it fits in my packet and hand easily. the touch screen is responsive. the camera is great. You can customize the tiles and there are plenty of apps to do whatever you want.I will love this phone for as long as it last (hoping for 2 years, any longer is a bonus). But if i had to do it over i would consider the Lumia 625... because it has radio.ps/ Turns out WP8 has podcasts. which is the only reason i have an ipod. so now i only carry one device.Update: 16/Jan/14- Now with radio. YAAH! after an update last night i now have FM radio. Happy Day. Now bumped to 4 stars.'),(390,'B00B1O15C6','I bought this phone less than a month ago. I was very happy so far, however I realized that camera is not stable on the back. One side have higher elevation and I had to push it and tape it, My suggestion for people who wants to buy this  phone is to but a protective cover which covers around camera and help it to be stable.It was also not mentioned on the ad but the phone was at&t; unlocked phone. Every time you turn it on, you will see the logo of the at&t; and I was reading that only way to get rid of it was to reset the phone. But I am kinda afraid of doing reset since it may cause to disappear some of the apps already there.If I had not realized the camera problem, the phone could be awesome.'),(391,'B00B1O15C6','The Good:The display is really great and vivid. Even though the display isn\'t HD it still looks great. The build is really nice, it\'s a bit heavy but you get used to it. UI is super snappy and fast. I\'ve been very happy with it. Camera isn\'t the greatest I\'ve seen but it is definitely more than sufficient for the price.The Bad:The back is really slippery to hold unless your hands are sweaty. Will probably need a case to accompany it. But, the only real con to this phone is that the signal/antenna is a bit weaker than other phones I\'ve tried. I have a weak signal in my house but most phones I\'ve had (I try lots of them) would at least stay connected to the network. The 820 showed &#34;no service&#34; a little too often. Something to be aware of.'),(392,'B00B1O15C6','Also found in all Nokia Lumia Windows Phone 8 smartphones are exclusive Nokia apps that can make life easier overall. Nokia Transit, Nokia Maps, Nokia CityLens and Nokia Music are only a few of them. Nokia CityLens is a particular favorite among users as it is helpful in locating places that are nearby, no matter what their location. For instance, if you are looking for a Chinese restaurant, you can find one in the scope of your current location simply by holding up your Nokia Lumia Windows Phone 8 phone with the app open and it will locate places near you. Nokia Music is similar to Pandora, but it does not use ads. It can provide a user with hours of entertainment, even if they do not have music already stored on their phone.

This year I decided to buy the lumia 920.... AWESOME... the battery is better than the last version, the international unblocked version works beautifuly.... I use this phone in costa rica... and I don\'t know if it is its software windows 8 but I have all the apps that I didnt have with thr the 900... tumblr, instagram, per example.  The camera is very good also... I simply love it!!'),(394,'B00B2BYU1Q','I have been tracking this phone ever since the Nov 2012 release, and I generally had mixed feelings about the types of reviews I read all over the internet. There have been complaints about the weight, about lack of an SD card slot, about it being a Windows phone, the list goes on. However, from experiencing this device for myself, I have to say that while it is not the perfect smartphone, it excels in most areas.The phone weighs 185g - considerably more than all of its direct competitors - but it does not feel like an anvil. It more has a solid, almost unbreakable feel (though I\'m not gonna test that). The Samsung Galaxy S3 was one of the main competitors at release date, and though it is lighter and thinner than the Lumia 920, it also feels quite frail in comparison. I don\'t find the weight of the phone to be a negative attribute.One other concern I had was how the WP8 environment would treat me, as it is well documented and demonstrated all over that the Windows App Store is leagues behind Google and iOS. There are obviously missing popular apps (not least Instagram and Youtube), but I have been able to find ample replacements so far (Metrotube and 6Tag) that do the job. If you aren\'t one to obsess over a name, then you will find these apps more than capable of handling most, if not all of your activities.The phone boasts silky smooth performance, with great visuals and above average speaker output. As far as media storage goes, I\'m not too concerned about the lack of SD card slot. The device already comes with 32gb built-in. Most other flagships at release date topped out at 16gb and not all offered SD storage either.The camera is probably the strongest selling point on any current-gen high end Nokia phone, and believe me, these guys have a right to brag. The camera is simply amazing, and there are a bunch of Nokia-exclusive imaging apps that make the photo experience so much better.Battery life is what I would call average from a smartphone these days and it is probably the biggest negative point on my mind right now. Depending upon usage and settings, battery life can vary greatly. If you are one of the users who turns screen brightness down all the way, turns off all services, and keeps the phone running on barebones features, then you can crank 2 days out of the battery easily. If you are like me - a moderate to heavy user who keeps his screen settings on automatic and doesn\'t bother to turn off things other than location settings, then you will get upwards of 11 hours out of a full charge. I\'ve seen better, but I\'ve also seen worse.Overall, I\'m satisfied with the phone. It was either this or a Xperia Z from Sony. The two are totally different experiences, but both have their strong and weak points. The price difference will probably play a role in the decision as well if you are torn between these 2 (though the release of the Z1 will surely drop the Z\'s price some more). For anybody questioning why I chose the Lumia 920 over the 925, the reasons are simple.The 925 only has 16gb onboard storage as opposed to 32gb on the 920.The 925 does not have a camera that much better than the 920The 925 did not come in red :)'),(395,'B00B8L7OEA','I am just a Nokia person, ever since I was a kid, started with unbreakable Nokia 3310, moved to the cute 5300 Xpress Music, then the mighty photographers\' choice, the N8, running on Symbian Belle which had more bugs as time went by... And now, it\'s finally time to taste the new Windows Phone experience, so I decided to try it and start with this \"lower?\" model.My first impression is that it\'s really smooth, and you don\'t get the feeling that this is a cheaper phone that is way behind the Lumia 920. Au contraire, it is just brilliant! The processor and memory handle the operating system really well, without any lags whatsoever and all the activities and apps I used to run on the N8 now run almost 10x faster on the Lumia 620.Talking about the apps, most of the ones I really need are available in the store, so I really have no complaints about it. Besides, most of the popular apps on the market today are all available on the Windows Phone app store and I believe it is gonna get even better as the Windows Phone market grows. The Nokia Maps and Drive are also some of the reasons why I stick to Nokia, because they have the best turn to turn navigation I have ever experienced (never got lost and never missed a highway exit on it, compared to some GPS like Garmin...). And now, they even added the Nokia City Lens, so I can just get lost in the big cities and find interesting places around me through the lens. Nokia\'s free music streaming is also wonderful, works great, you can even download playlists for free so that you can stream them offline later if you don\'t want to use your mobile data. Kudos!About the mobile data, 3G is just enough for me... I can stream radio stations, songs and videos smoothly on T-mobile\'s 3G internet, and the internet browser seemed to run as fast as when I use the Wifi access point, so I don\'t have any complaints on that.Another great thing on the OS is its social interface, combining my phone contacts with those from Google, Hotmail, Yahoo, Skype, Facebook and all that you want. Now, all my peeps are in one place, I can just look for their names and see what they\'re up to on Facebook, have a quick video call on Skype, e-mail, call or text them, locate or drive to their place... all of that in just one place instead of having to open each and every social app individually. How convenient!Of course, I wouldn\'t say that this phone is perfect, and the OS either... the 2 complaints I have so far are the battery life on the phone (this is maybe where the higher end Lumias shine), and the fact that the OS won\'t have a close button on opened apps tab like you could on the Symbian OS, instead, you have to select each tab and hit the back button while the app is open so that you can close it. Yeah, it\'s true that those opened apps in the background will not take any CPU usage (except for music and streaming stuffs), but I still prefer the quick close button on the old Symbian that saved me so much time.But overall, this is a great phone to start your Windows Phone experience. Would highly recommend it if you aren\'t too picky on the app store!'),(396,'B00B9Q9BRM','This is the international version of this phone. Specifically, it is intended to be used in Malaysia. You\'ll have to go through a couple of the settings dialogs to set the language and region if that\'s not where you live. Once that\'s done, it will work just the same.T-Mobile uses the GSM 2100 band for it\'s \"4G\" network, though keep in mind T-Mobile\'s \"4G\" network is more like 3.5G (more accurately it should be called HSPA+). It is slower than the other major U.S. carriers. It works fine with this phone, even if T-Mobile tells you it won\'t. Speed tests show it\'s on their fastest network. AT&T; HSPA+ should work as well on the GSM 1900 band, but I have not verified it.Most importantly: do not update the Access Point app from Nokia on this phone! The factory version works fine, but the updated version breaks internet sharing. This is extremely annoying. Perhaps a future update will resolve the problem, but for now, you have to leave it alone.The Lumia 620\'s main body is black. This white cover acts as the battery cover, physical buttons, and a protective cover. The phone isn\'t useable without it. This is too bad, because the phone itself is very skinny but this cover makes it an overall thick phone. All the covers I see for sale are placed on top of this existing cover, which I find silly. The one exception is a durable cover from Nokia, which is even thicker.You can find lots of reviews of the Lumia line online. I picked this one because it was near my price range for an off-contract phone. It\'s got a nicer screen than the 520, but doesn\'t have the great camera of the 920. The 720 was very tempting, but out of my price range. I think the 620 is the best value of the series right now.I get a full day\'s charge with more than an hour of web-browsing, an hour of music streaming to headphones, three updating email accounts, and a half-hour of voice. This isn\'t great, but good enough for me.UPDATE: The Amber (GDR2) update breaks internet sharing for T-Mobile customers. You\'ll get an error that your plan does not include this option, but T-Mobile will tell you they can\'t help as this is an unsupported phone. After months of hard resets and changing APN settings, I finally found a fix: download the Japanese QWERTY keyboard from Settings > Keyboards. This is a crazy solution - certifiably, undeniably mad. Once the keyboard downloads, you will need to reboot and the phone will perform some kind of update. Then it works. I\'m typing this from my laptop tethered to this phone now.This phone has continued performing well over the last 6 months. I have a couple of tiny scratches on the edges of the screen, but otherwise it is in good shape. The battery has been lasting a full day as long as use it only moderately. With internet sharing working again, I am completely satisfied with this phone.'),(397,'B00B9Q9BRM','I bought this phone a couple of months ago to use it Costa Rica. It works wonderfully. Looks great and it\'s a good buy for the price. You a get a smartphone with the things you need. WP8 is very easy to use. The app market is rising which is good. If you are a first time smartphone user you get all the basic apps you need.Positive things: easy to handle, sleek look, small size (I don\'t like those over sized phones), price.Things that could be better: battery life, camera (takes good outdoor pictures, but inside ones could be better, the use of some apps helps to get better shots).Overall I\'m happy with the phone and recommend the Lumia experience.'),(398,'B00B9Q9BRM','1. this unit bought on Amazon doesn\'t come with English as default language. Took me a while to switch to English interface (by pure luck as I coudn\'t read the buttons and instructions), and I still couldn\'t figure out what the initial language is, possibly Vietnamese. After English appeared, the soft keyboard still displays a bunch of unknow characters (of the initial language)2. the microphone broke - there\'s no sound when making a call. I had to switch to Speaker mode or plug in earphone to hear the sound. Not sure it\'s factory defect or software issue! Anyone had such experience?3. the onboarding experience with Windows Phone OS was not smooth to say the least. For example, adding Microsoft Account and sync\'ing my email account (i happened to have a Yahoo account as Microsoft account) was confusing, and moving and changing size of tiles etc all relied on some help from friends.4. the People Hub doesn\'t sync with Windows 8\'s People App. I added a few new contacts on my laptop using the People App on Windows 8, but they never showed up on the People Hub on the phone. Microsoft just couldn\'t make all pieces work together.'),(399,'B00B9Q9BRM','Picked mine up in Thailand last month for 8,200 Thai baht from the Nokia Store there to learn about the Win Phone 8 operating system first hand (8200 baht turned up on my credit card as $268). I was surprised by how much I liked the operating system, it really is very appealing and slick as reported by tech writers, and on the Lumia 620 was quick and responsive - the 620 doesn\'t make the \"single core, underpowered\" mistake of the first Win Phone 7 products from other companies. It is dual core, modern with good graphics, and quite snappy throughout. The screen quality itself is superb, subject to the caveat that while it is much sharper than an iPhone 3GS with perhaps better black levels and colors, it doesn\'t have the high pixel density of a Retina Display like on iPhone 4 and up models. Pixel density is much better than an iPhone 3GS and below for reading FaceBook posts and emails, but not as sharp as I would want these days for book reading or \"serious\" video watching. The higher range of Win Phone 8 models do have HD resolution levels (the Lumia 620 is akin to DVD level resolution) but of course cost much more.But I didn\'t buy this for \"serious\" uses. I bought it to access FaceBook - both for consumption (reading messages and news feed) and content creation (status updates with pictures). The fact that Internet Explorer gives me full access to the web is a bonus - don\'t forget, when you bemoan the lack of an app for every almost trivial purpose, that the web through a browser is the \"original\" mother of all apps.So what I cared about the most was a compact body (flying in the face of my 4.3\" Nexus 4, not to mention Samsung S3\'s and Galaxy Notes) with a fine screen, great \"playful-functional\" design, and superlow pricing. I was sold when I found out I could insert a sub-$60, 64gb microSD card, which would allow me to use it as a music player in lieu of an iPod Touch (the Lumia 620 has great audio quality - and if you like to play with \"surround sound,\" Dolby Headphone - which can be turned on or off - is included). While these days I don\'t make many actual voice calls, I was pleasantly surprised that the unit includes the dual, noise canceling microphones from the higher model line.Set up was easy. Microsoft recently nagged me into converting an old Hotmail account to their new Outlook address, and I just used that account to sign in. Since that is pretty much an unused account, I also logged in with GMail and it imported all my Google telephone and email contacts after I gave it permission to do so. Once it had my credentials, it also logged me into my YouTube account. FaceBook isn\'t linked by credentials to GMail, so that and Skype (surprisingly enough, since Skype is owned by MS) were was the only accounts I had to sign into  manually.During the remaining two weeks I had in Thailand, I used the phone to keep up on FaceBook. Text prediction was on par with Apple and better than Android 4.2; but there was no \"swipe\" option. Telephone audio was good on both cellular and Skype, but Skype was very dependent, as expected, on the wifi connection. The camera is very satisfactory, by current standards, in bright light, but could be better in low light without a flash. The front camera is sufficient for video calls, but the 720, which will be out soon, has much better optics front and rear. As a music player, quality is superb, but not audiophile as on the iPod Touch 5th gen. Nokia Music (a free streaming service) is excellent. In fact the Nokia apps themselves are quite good, and Nokia maps has an excellent reputation.The nice thing about the 620 is that it doesn\'t scream \"steal me\" like an iPhone or large screen Android phone seems to do these days; it has an incredibly loud ringer; the body is small and easy to stow, but the screen is larger than on an iPhone 4s and below.My favorite \"new\" app on Win Phone 8 is Skype - Microsoft owns Skype and is busily integrating old Hotmail and Microsoft instant messaging features into Skype, and making Skype more user friendly. Certainly despite some residual funkiness, Skype is the best alternative to FaceTime which is limited to Apple devices (Skype is platform agnostic - there are versions for Win Phone 8, for Android, for iPhone, for Windows desktops/laptops, for Mac desktops/laptops). While Line, WhatsApp, Viber, and other message/video applications are trying to stake out smartphone space, Skype is enjoying a renaissance (it never really went away) and is MUCH easier for me and my friends to use than Google+ Hangouts (which are more powerful, but a lot harder to use).The most serious \"bugs\" I have encountered are losing my place in the FaceBook news stream if I activate a pop up window to \"like\" or \"comment\" or read comments; and the ringer volume and music volume controls are one and the same, meaning I have to turn the speaker volume way up for a loud ringer, but drop it all the way down to listen to music through headphones. If you forget, you won\'t hear your ringer and/or your ears will get blasted.This is a great first, second, kid\'s, and travel phone. It isn\'t designed to be, and isn\'t, a \"premium\" phone but there are so many little \"premium\" touches that you will feel that you got more than your money\'s worth, and never feel you are in a \"penalty box.\" The one I am reviewing is like mine - an international GSM edition which is factory unlocked. Although mine will take a T-Mobile sim (and run well on the T-Mobile network at HSPA+ speeds, which are quasi LTE speeds, although LTE bands are NOT included) - I am just using mine here on wifi for Skype calls, and as a music player. When I travel again, I will buy a \"travelers package SIM/activation/plan\" at the airport which will give me 3gb of data for one month at 3g and HSPA+ speeds - depending on provider. It\'s a lot more appealing to use this almost-disposable phone in lieu of my more premium phone while traveling.Note: Lumia 620\'s in \"white\" come with a replaceable BLACK back cover, so what you are getting, from one point of view, is a traditional black phone with an interchangeable white cover option. Tech writers have noted that the removable and replaceable hard glass/carbonate covers include the speaker and USB jacks, two points of common failure, so the failure of a port won\'t disable this phone as designed - just swap in your extra cover, or buy a new one for about $30. On the other hand, good luck finding any suitable after market gummy or thin polycarbonate cover for this one - given the design, you will probably want to go \"coverless\" on this one. You\'ll see what I mean when you check one out in person.Finally, you should go to the international Nokia website and study the specs for the just-released Lumia 720. Same screen resolution, but bigger screen (so you won\'t see more text, but the text you see will be larger); same processor and speed; much better front and rear cameras (Carl Zeiss lens on the back, designed for low light without flash; wide angle front lens in HD resolution, for better video conferencing, better \"selfies,\" and the wide angle allows including a friend in the conference). NOT a playful cover design - designed to be very slab like, but ultra thin. Only $50-$75 more.The even less expensive 520 that will be appearing at T-Mobile shortly lacks two important features of the 620 - mainly a camera flash and a front camera (so you can\'t do video chats). It also lacks NFC but personally I don\'t use that, and NFC is probably not a big deal for the emerging markets targeted by the 520 (touchless payments at cafes, for example). So I recommend starting with the 620 and giving some consideration to the 720.'),(400,'B00B9Q9BRM','This is a perfectly capable phone, with the clean and nice WP8 interface and lots of features for a low price. Unlike the other reviewer, my unit came only with the white cover, but I wasn\'t really expecting anything different. If you like Windows Phone but are limited in your budget, this is a wonderful choice. If you want to try something different this phone will perform WAY better than any cheap android phone, with the advantage of the exclusive Nokia apps, and the brand well known quality build.Surprising little details: even though the screen is LCD, it displays good black levels and it\'s surprisingly good to read under sunlight. Also, even though most reviews said the camera was terrible, I found it decent enough for average use. Obviously it\'s not lumia 920 quality, but good enough for most cases, even some night pictures. The cover is very soft and nice to touch. It can be cleaned easily.Now some things to consider: the battery is one of the smallest I\'ve seen in most recent smartphones of this range. However, it will probably last you through a normal day. The phone comes with 8 GB of internal memory, which can be expanded via micro SD. HOWEVER, currently (April 8 2013) apps can only be installed on the internal memory. That may change in the future with an update, but nobody really knows. It won\'t probably be an issue for most, but if you need to install big apps, or apps that may need a lot of space to store data (like deezer for offline music), you might want to consider your priorities.In summary: wonderful phone for a great price.'),(401,'B00B9Q9BRM','I\'m a big Windows Phone lover.  I had the HTC Arrive and then got a Lumia 920.  Before any of these I had a Zune HD.  I thought that was an excellent device and the Zune Pass couldn\'t be beat.  Well when MS sadly disabled music downloading on Zune HD\'s it was tough because that was one of the biggest features I liked about it.  I then thought about getting a Windows Phone that was cheap to replace it.  I looked at the 810 at the time and thought it was too big.  I decided to just wait a bit for the phone prices to come down and maybe get the 810 anyways.  Well then Nokia announced the 620.  I thought it was perfect!  I\'d be able to add my Zune pass (no XBOX Music Pass) and be able to stream Pandora, Spotify and Nokia Music to it which the Zune HD couldn\'t do.  On my Zune HD it wouldn\'t even accept my companies Wifi connection so the 620 had another plus here.  I waited for the 620 to hit $200 which is way cheaper than a Zune HD at $500+ BTW.When I first got it the size seemed awesome coming from my Lumia 920 which is still my daily phone.  The screen isn\'t like my 920 but it is good enough,  FF Camera, the size is great for my purposes (an mp3 player) and it\'s great as a second device when my 920 battery runs out  which is rarely ever.I highly recommend this phone!'),(402,'B00CBY28K8','As the owner of Lumia 710 I wanted an upgrade to the newer operating system, and a little more modern look. The only negative for me is the fact that the battery is not replaceable. I since have found several vendors who will replace my battery when the time comes . This is the same as Iphones and Ipods. I don\'t know why I hesitated. The battery life is very good. I can go 2 days with moderate usage. that compares to 1 day for the Lumia 710. I still hve the Lumia 710 and sometimes I use it as a radio in the workshop. My wife uses hers (unlocked). When I use hers, sometimes I wonder why I ever changed. I guess I\'m just a Lumia fan.'),(403,'B00CBY28K8','One of the main reasons I went with this phone is advertised battery life, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that I only need to charge it once every two days, and even once every 4 days with light use.I like the Windows 8 interface - it\'s intuitive and is aesthetically pleasing. A lot of the little details have been given enough attention: dialling, messaging, the browser don\'t have any clear flaws. Overall, I think it\'s about the same as an Android device (which I have used) or an iOS one, i.e. a good OS with no major flaws. I also like the HERE Maps app, though there is a Google Maps for Windows which one can download if absolutely needed (I have not needed it yet).There is one minor missing feature in the OS which I get to later in the review.The device itself is quick (in spite of the 500MB memory), though I have downloaded only about 15 apps in addition to the ones which the OS came bundled with. Given I am not likely to download too many more, I don\'t see performance being an issue for me. The touch-screen is also very responsive, and the physical buttons for volume, the on/off and the camera are all useful. Also, the phone looks fantastic! It\'s slim, sleek and I really like the sharp(ish) corners. It\'s also rather light for a phone of its size. The music also sounds great on the phone, though not as good as on my Cowon MP3 player.One major complaint of Windows devices is the relative paucity of apps for the platform. I have not really found this to be a problem as nearly all the standard apps are available (Pandora, Kindle, Amazon, Weather etc.) and work very well. I don\'t use apps for websites though, so my demand for apps is not that high. But even then, firms are also paying attention to the Windows OS now, so the shortage of apps may not last very long.The only little flaw I have found in the phone is OS-related: There is no way to enable an alert if you have an unread SMS or a missed call. On my old (non-smart) device, I could get the phone to beep and vibrate every few minutes if I have missed a call or text message, but on this device, I don\'t realize this until I actually look at my phone. It\'s a nice-to-have feature (not enough for me to drop the rating to 4 stars) and I hope Windows builds this into one their future releases.To summarize, I\'ll say it\'s a very good phone to buy. I look at it as an Android or iOS phone which looks great and has great battery life.EDIT: After nearly 4 months of use at this point, I stand by the good rating I gave earlier on but have to adjust my rating for these reasons:1. The touch-screen of this phone has begun to hang periodically, rendering it unusable. The buttons on the side for volume and power continue to work, so it\'s only a problem with the touch-screen. Soft and hard resets don\'t help.2. This phone is not covered by Nokia\'s warranty in the United States. Hence, I will either have to pay to have the phone fixed or write-off the $290 I spent on it and get a new one.'),(404,'B00CKUBLFQ','PROS: +unlocked smartphone for less than $150, +AGPS+maps, +office suite, +OneNote app, +email clients, +data usage limit monitor/cutoff background app, +many 2G/3G/4G bands +3.5 mm audio jack.

Downside of course that screen is 4 inch with 480x800 resolution which is not that fantastic for productivity. The phone case is some sort of mix between rubber and plastic. This phone might .. maybe .. perhaps .. survive some smaller drops without a extra protective case which is rare in the smartphone category. I appreciated the easy plugin of 3.5 mm computer stereo headphones. Sound recording in OneNote using phone own microphone and playback through headset worked. Having top notch maps and navigation download for free with the phone price is definitely added value. Lumia 520 does not have front facing camera.

The phone works great, I have never been one for windows 8 for the PC but its great for a phone. The phone is smooth, however note that google accounts do not sync and if you export you contacts from and Android you can\'t import it to the Windows phone (or at least I haven\'t figure out how) so you will have to figure out a new way to transfer your contacts.

It comes with separate wall charger, usb cable and earphones. Unlike the most of android phones in that price range this phone has much better options.

Then the camera has nice touch-to-focus option but some of the photos have noise, the video quality is very nice and has also auto-focus option. The display is crystal-clear and is big enough (4.0 Inches). Also one more good option are HERE MAPS that come with free downloadable maps and navigation voice for the entire planet. Also one more good thing about his phone are the upcoming windows 8.1 and lumia cyan update which will bring additional options like Cortana (similar to ask Siri) and the swipe keyboard.The only con of this phone is the RAM Memory (512 MB) which isn\'t enough for some apps.

At first, I was excited about the features that Nokia offers compared to the iPhone. This phone takes screen shots, has hotspot, and a text and call blocking feature. But as I continued to use this phone, I noticed that all of my favorite apps were not available for Windows phones and the app that were available are not free with Windows phones as they are with iOS and Android.Since the phone was very affordable I tried to overlook the lack of apps issue until I notice that my phone would not install the updates for my apps.  I called AT&T; technical support to help me with this problem (the techician was really great) which led to the technician calling Microsoft .  Microsoft informed us that they do not have a support team to assist with window\'s phones issues and that they could not help or assist us with any problems the phone may have.

It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I\'ve bought a few apps from the MS App Store and have learned some things that may help others now, so I\'ll discuss them briefly.I wanted a basic phone with media player capabilities, at low cost.  I have all \"connectedness\" turned off and can\'t comment on the Facebook etc apps, nor on the maps and GPS.  I installed a 32GB SD card because I wasn\'t sure how well it all would work.  Now I wish I\'d gotten 64GB.  I have WiFi \'on\' only when I\'m downloading apps, which works well.I bought YXPlayer for $5, ignoring the negative comments in the MS App Store.  Sadly, it has no support (forum dead for months) and there seems to be no alternative.  BUT reading from the SD, this app smoothly plays all FLVs, AVIs and MKVs I\'ve tried, including 720p and 1080p using x264 encoding.  YXPlayer also handles my FLAC lossless music files, and MP3s.  So I believe it will handle all the formats the vendor claims.  Note that MP3s must be renamed to .RM to play from the SD card.  You might also have to rename MP4s.  All these files can be in subfolders on the SD.  I was worried that the 4\" screen would be too small to enjoy films, but it\'s just big enough.  This is great: personal theater in the palm of your hand.  My only complaints with YXPlayer are that the dragbar (to move within a film or long audio file) is flaky; and the app will not advance to the next track (music or video) under any conditions.  So you must manually start each song.  That\'s pretty bad, and unlikely to be fixed at this point.Of course the 520\'s bundled music player will play MP3s directly, but still without a dragbar, and space on the phone is limited.  If you use that app you\'ll want to properly tag the files (Artist, Album, Track Name) so the player can sort them out.I bought Fiction Book Reader for $1.  This reads .MOBI and .EPUB books just fine.  To use it, first put the book files on the root (not in a subfolder) of the SD card.  Then use the down-arrow button within FBR to import the file into FBR\'s workspace in the phone\'s memory.Most reviews of the 520 oddly omit the MS Office (Word, Excel, and Powerpoint) tools that come with the phone!  With these you can view existing documents and make detail changes eg to cell values.  I find this amazing on such a tiny device.  HOWEVER, in true Microsoft fashion, access to these powerful apps is crippled.  You cannot open documents you\'ve loaded via USB or the SD card!  You can only open files from email or from SkyDrive.  Still, the capability is there and very impressive.I have screen brightness turned all the way up, which seemed essential for movies but would not otherwise be needed.  Battery life under these conditions is probably about 4 hrs of video, but I\'m only guessing.Overall the Nokia 520 represents amazing value; probably unbeatable if your needs are as limited as mine.  Consider that an unlocked Nokia 1520 is five times the price!  That has a better quality, 6\" screen, a better toy camera, and twice the raw performance - but performance isn\'t an issue with the 520; everything responds quickly and smoothly.  The main limitations are inherent with Windows Phone 8, not the 520.  I love it so far.'),(422,'B00CKUBLFQ','Bought this as a gift for my GF and so far the phone has not disappointed in the least.

What people who read these comments and watch online is that first off this is a BUDGET phone and not a high-end smartphone but a low costing smartphone that doesn\'t have much internal storage as the apps are stored direct to the phone itself and it has a 5mp shooter that upon hearing such with no flash to boot there should be 0 issues with that.Stop paying under $200 for a smartphone, getting performance like you\'ve spent $2000 and then question why it doesn\'t do this or do that? No front facing camera, no large internal storage but take those two away and you have the best budget smartphone avl today. I tested everything and they work perfectly, I was pleasantly surprised by that and I am looking forward to the next major update as for the $ spent on this and getting an update that allows the phone to work on par with those that costs 2/3X more you surely/simply cannot go wrong with this purchase.The App store is as it is small in comparison to others but if you want Apps just for the sake of telling your friends and family I have a phone that I can get every single app out there and they work but in reality only use 2 out of the hundreds of thousands then go ahead by my guest.

The down side is that the phone loses my WiFi connections every time it\'s powered down. Apparently, this is a KNOWN ISSUE. It looks like I can fix it by going into my router settings and making some changes. As everything else in my house has no issues connecting wireless with the router, there\'s no way I\'m going to change the settings. I haven\'t tried the phone on WiFi outside of my house yet to see if it\'s just an issue with my router or something bigger.

If you use this phone with a plan like Net10, you do have to enter in some APN codes to get internet to work, but it if you Google the codes its pretty simple and the internet was up and running after I did that!So I would highly recommend this unlocked phone to anyone, especially if you are going the prepaid route because it\'s unlocked.Enjoy!!!'),(430,'B00CKUDPS2','I absolutely love this phone, it came super quick, works amazingly, and I couldn\'t be happier!

Slightly better build quality. The plastic cover feels good but I still expected something a bit more sturdy.2. Windows Phone 8 is GREAT. Yes I\'m serious but it can definitely use more apps3. The new IE on WP8 is great too, but I\'d like to be able to use Firefox or Chrome too occasionally.4. 8 GB storage is not much, especially almost half of it is used by the system.

The Lumia also had a few more apps than the 808, but I have not found any that I need, that do not have their equivalent in Symbian.  This Lumia telephone certainly does the job, make calls, record, take pictures, etc. fairly well and effectively.  The four stars represent my evaluation of the telephone when compared to my 808, which although not perfect, still has a better camera.  Pity Nokia has discontinued support for Symbian.  I have no experience with Android or Apple OSs.'),(438,'B00D1A37OM','First, I have to say that I\'ve been a Nokia customer for several years.  My work often sends me to foreign lands, and when I arrive at my destination, I purchase local SIM cards for my current Nokia.  Since I always bought INTERNATIONAL versions of my previous Nokia phones, I\'ve never had a problem with compatibility with local networks.  With my Nokia phones, I also stuck with the flagship models.  Nokia\'s maps & GPS always seems to be better than what my co-workers might bring with them.  Nokia\'s models also seemed sturdier than what other brands offered.Last spring, my old Nokia N97 began to have a screen display problem.  I started looking for a replacement, and the first thing I found was that Nokia has abandoned their old Symbian operating system.  I never really liked that system, but I was used to it, and it had matured over the years to where it was working well with my Windows desktop, laptop and other devices.  I had equated the Symbian OS on my first couple of Nokia\'s with the one old desktop that I had run using the LINUX OS.  You had to be pretty geeky to use it, but it was pretty powerful if you were an \"IT\" guy.By staying with Nokia, my first compromise was giving up Symbian for the Windows Phone 8 OS.  I held off on that decision until I could \'hands on\' try Android and WP8.Then, as I researched the Lumia 9xx \'flagship\' models, I immediately discovered that the batteries were sealed in the case, and that there was no sdMicro card slot.  Those two missing things were an immediate deal breaker for me.  I am so used to carrying a 2nd battery, and a backup sdMicro card when I travel - I can\'t imagine traveling without them.I had to bump down my Nokia choices to the next best models, the Lumia 8xx models.  That meant the AT&T; 820, the Verizon 822, or the T-Mobile 810 as the only three to choose from.  I don\'t like AT&T; as a company, and Verizon doesn\'t service my area, so I\'d be staying with T-Mobile.My next step was to go to the T-Mobile store, and try their Windows Phone 8 models.  There was an HTC, a Samsung, and the Nokia 810 all running on WP8.  I played with all three, and found them quite similar, except that the Nokia had the really cool Nokia map & GPS based apps already installed.  The new WP8 OS was instantly easy to navigate.  I really liked it.  I bought the Lumia 810 outright, right in the store.After two days at home, the Lumia died.  It just turned itself off, and nothing would wake it up.  The only way to get it going again was to remove the back, pull the battery loose, reinsert it, and it was back running again.  Over the next week, with the phone just sitting on my desk, it did the same thing several times, seemingly at random.  Some web searching found that a lot of people had the same problem... but some didn\'t.  I saw that T-Mobile had discontinued the phone the same week that I had bought mine.  I took mine back to T-Mobile, got my refund, and put my old Nokia N97 back into service.  T-Mobile still didn\'t have their Lumia 925 model available.  I\'d have to wait.During the next few months, I kept checking on what was available, and also hoping that HTC or Samsung might have a comparable interchangeable battery model available.  But, wait!  Some other models with interchangeable batteries were reporting similar problems.  Not nearly a many as the Lumia 810, but there were some.When the T-Mobile Lumia 925 finally arrived, it was heralded as the best of the Lumia 9xx series.  I still hesitated, and then the AT&T; came out with their Lumia 1020 model - which I assume will be followed by the Verizon and T-Mobile versions.  Awesome phone, but obviously, the sealed case is here to stay.  I went back to researching, and decided to try for an International version of the Lumia 810 on Amazon.  If I got another one with the same problem as the first one, I could easily return it, and resign myself to a phone with a sealed case.When this one arrived, I put it to the test for three weeks before going to T-Mobile for a new SIM card.  After several faultless days, I tried it with a 2nd new Nokia battery, and three days later, it went belly up.  I put the original battery back in, and tested for another two weeks, without a glitch.  About two weeks ago, I went back to T-Mobile, and changed the SIM card.  (Actually, they just cut the old N97 SIM down to the micro size).  The Lumia 810 is still running without a hitch.  I\'m glad I took the chance on getting one of the good ones.It\'s apparent to me that the current sellers of this phone bought up T-Mobile\'s remaining stock, certainly knowing that some would undoubtedly be returned.  Now that I have a good one, I would have given it five stars... I do love it.  The missing fifth star is due to the relatively poor interface with Windows 7 on the esktop.  Symbian (and OVI) eventually got their interface with Windows to be very robust.  I could manage so many things on the phone through my desktop, especially the CONTACTS list with OUTLOOK.  Now, I\'m back to the infancy days of Windows desktop management of my phone data and files.Since MICROSOFT has recently purchased most of the NOKIA company, I\'m assuming that the desktop - phone interface will be greatly improved in the near future.  That would make this phone worthy of five stars.'),(439,'B00D1A37OM','I wanted this phone.I\'m a T-Mobile customer and wanted a second phone with a low-cost pre-paid option and this is it. The Lumia 810 was specifically created for T-Mobile and was originally sold on a 2-year contract. The company no longer offers the phone but does support it and it can be used on any T-Mobile plan. I currently use my 810 on the company\'s $30 a month phone/data/text plan that gives me everything I need. I added a 32GB micro SD card for music, photos and videos because the phone only has 8GB HD but it hasn\'t been a problem whatsoever. The 810 is - in my opinion - one of the better looking - if not slightly thicker - Windows phones available but I have been very happy with it. The built-in HERE Drive app is worth the price of admission and the Nokia MixMusic app is a very solid ad-free streaming service that can be upgraded with unlimited skips for $3.99 a month.Update 4/6/2014: T-Mobile is not providing additional software updates to the Lumia 810 despite the fact that Nokia is making them available. The Nokia Black update that was pushed out to T-Mobile\'s 520 and 925 Lumia models was not made available the 810 and there\'s a strong belief it will not be able to receive the upcoming 8.1 OS update from Microsoft/Nokia which will likely affect the phone\'s ability to load newer apps. There\'s some discussion that Microsoft/Nokia have said that all Lumias currently running WP 8.0 will be upgraded regarded of carrier support - including the 810 - but that is by no means certain and I wouldn\'t invest $200+ in a phone that is at this moment EOL\'d. That said, this phone is still very solid, works well and if you don\'t need the latest/greatest is an affordable choice for 95% of smartphone customers who prefer the WindowsPhone operating system and don\'t want to settle for the 500-series models the company is selling for $99.'),(440,'B00D1A37OM','Is this the absolute best T-Mobile Windows Phone to-date?Well, depends on your needs - for my needs, yes - it\'s the best.At a bare minimum, I wanted a T-Mobile phone with Windows Phone OS, Removable Batteries, Micro-sd slots and Wireless charging capability. Plus, I need a phone with a reasonably sized screen that doesn\'t look awkward in my dress-pants,This phone fits the bill (NOTE: for wireless-charging capability, you do need to replace the back cover with a wireless charging one). I bought the Lumia 810 when it first came out and two years later, there\'s still no better option in specs that fits my minimum requirements. I lost my phone and I\'m finding myself now purchasing the exact same phone as I had two years ago because there\'s nothing better! T-Mobile really needs to get their act together and have Nokia make them a better smartphone than those cheap 500 and 600-series phones that were intended to replace the 810.Yes, the Lumia 925 has better specs in several ways - but it does NOT have removable batteries, or a micro SD-card slot. Plus, it\'s kinda big in the pants.Personally, I don\'t like being tethered to a power-source, always looking for somewhere to charge my phone. You can say all you want about portable battery chargers/power-banks - but nothing beats carrying a few small spare batteries - especially if you\'re hiking, camping, travelling on long trips. Even that extra battery in your jeans pocket can be a life-saver on a night-out! Micro-SD capability also affords me a lot of versatility.If your needs are similar to mine and T-Mobile is your carrier, look no further!PS - T-Mobile no longer supports/pushes Windows Phone OS updates to this phone - but you can install the Microsoft Lumia Black update (beta) on pretty much any phone that has Windows Phone 8. This is an official Microsoft update (do a search for \"Lumia Black Preview for Developers\")  - the beauty of it is that it\'s the latest and greatest version of the OS, and it untethers you from having to wait on your carrier to push updates.'),(441,'B00D1A37OM','Overall it is a nice phone. A few quirks were that google couldn\'t sync my contacts so I had to take it to t-mobile and have them pull my contacts off my old phone. Also you WILL have to create an outlook account to get the phone to work. Do that FIRST before trying to set the phone up. I wanted to throw it through a window when I first got it now I like it. Since it is a window\'s phone some apps you can\'t get and some apps don\'t sync like candy crush :(The battery life is ok... Keep a charger close by. It takes nice photos and having microsoft office products available is nice. Once you get used to using an windows phone vs an android it\'s ok.'),(442,'B00D1A37OM','We have had two other Nokia phones models in the family and they have been reliable and long lasting. So far, so good on this one. Easy to figure out set-up and personalization. Solidly built. Reasonably priced. It was easy to sync with my car\'s bluetooth phone feature.The not-so-good: battery life is 12-15 hours, even with little use. Not sure if this is a bad battery, or, could be my fault for not thinking through delivery--It was outside my front door in -30 degree temps! Not a good delivery plan on my part, in retrospect. Secondly, I wear small in women\'t gloves, the phone is too wide for me to hold in one hand and operate the entire keyboard with my thumb of the same hand. Lastly, the volume button is in a bad place. Easy to press during normal use. Almost daily I find I have accidentally lowered my volume so much that I missed calls.I will continue to recommend and purchase Nokia phones.'),(443,'B00D1A37OM','This is my first smart phone and I love it. It is so easy to use. Settings are a breeze because there are short explanations about the choices you have. In my opinion this OS defines &#34;user friendly&#34;. Very nicely designed. The home screen is completely customizable. So its all the things you access most and with a swipe you find the complete menu. The look of the phone itself is sleek and understated with a nice quality feel. So far (two weeks) I\'m completely satisfied and would highly recommend this device.'),(444,'B00D1A37OM','The phone is great for the price I paid for it, but Windows Phone is still lacking in many basic features.  Windows Phone itself is fast and all the functions included like SMS, Emailing, Web Browsing, and the Camera are great.  Going from screen to screen and app to app is fast and fluid, and Nokia\'s software suite such as Here Maps and Drive and the Nokia Camera software are top notch.  However, several apps that I use daily are not available on Windows Phone yet and the notification system is severely lacking compared to other smartphones.  I\'m hanging on to this phone in hopes that Microsoft does introduce a better notification manager in Windows Phone 8.1, which is being rumored.  Overall, it\'s a nice phone for the price and does a lot of things well, but the notification system and lack of common apps made me go back to a different smartphone.'),(445,'B00D1A37OM','I have been using the Nokia Lumia 710 for 2 years until the phone stopped charging. I LOVED my 710, but  was forced to buy a new phone. The 710 used Window 7. I have a window 8 laptop and I love it so I thought time to upgrade to a Nokia Lumia Window 8 phone, so I chose the 810. Do not regret my decision.Like =  I thought my Nokia Lumia 710 camera were good, but the 810 is even better. I love the fact the product is light. Bigger screen, the sensitive touch screen. I enjoy the auto updates of my tiles for Facebook and emails (you can change the setting if you do not want auto update to save battery). Battery life on this phone is way better than on the 710. The noise quality is good and the volume is pretty loud. Video quality is good.  oooh and it can charge wireless but you do need to buy the separate wireless charger.dislike - if  charging the phone wirelessly not all cases work for wireless charging. Make sure you buy the right case for wireless charging.'),(446,'B00D1A37OM','I\'ve had this phone for two years now, with Tmobile. I just came from a really small Blackberry so switching over was a very different experience. Instead of keys, I had a touch screen, large enough for me to read comfortably in, and finally the ability to use more apps! (Using apps on the small blackberry was pretty... difficult). I really enjoyed the phone for about a few months, and then I grew tired of it.Because Windows had just started up, there weren\'t many apps in the store for me to purchase that I could actually use, and the &#34;bulkiness&#34; of the phone began to irritate me. But to be honest, After sticking with this phone for two years and going, I\'ve come to really appreciate this &#34;discontinued&#34;, &#34;out-dated&#34; Nokia model.Firstly, this is my first windows Nokia phone. I don\'t know about any of the other series, so I really can\'t compare them for you, but I do know that I am incredibly grateful for how sturdy this phone. Two years, and all I have is a minor crack on the front screen from dropping the phone on it\'s touch-screen face to the concrete floor. Once, out of the many, many, many times I\'ve dropped this phone -- and I only got one irrelevant crack. Mind you, this is a decently sized crack -- but I\'m also saying that the damage could\'ve been much much worse had it been a more fragile of a phone build. In this way, the fact that it\'s a little &#34;bulky&#34; is a little good.Because you can switch out the shells on the back of the phone, you can always replace your old dirty scratched up one for a new one, and they aren\'t that expensive -- incase you wanted to change the color, or if you simply wanted to replace it. The accessories aren\'t too expensive compared to that of many other updated smart phones because this one is discontinued. Thankfully I was able to buy a wireless charging shell for this phone while they were still available - for a very decent price. The product is good too [http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Wireless-Charging-Shell-CC-3063/dp/B00AOU49SK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1405117706&sr;=8-2&keywords;=wireless+nokia+charger+shell].So, after two years of using this phone, this phone does glitch from time to time. There were moments when the texting kinda &#34;freezes&#34; up on the phone, and you have to go back to the main menu, reclick the tile to text, and hope the phone gets over its own glitch. It\'s pretty minor, in my opinion, and for me I was able to work past it so it wasn\'t a big deal. You get to add a SD card for more space, so by just popping a 16GB or 32GB baby in there, you can have quite a bit of luxurious space to stock up on photos, music, the like. Camera-wise, there are a lot of phones with a better camera quality than this one now, but I\'m still content with it. No one looks awfully discolored or anything like that.In terms of apps NOW, Windows has been working very efficiently to get the hottest apps available first, such as Wellsfargo (banking), Facebook, Twitter, all that social media, Evernote, Amazon, etc etc. Before I was a little irked at the lack in apps, and certainly it is still lacking in apps compared to the larger competitors out there (Apple and Android), but I don\'t think this will be as big of an issue in the future when Windows further close this gap too. Honestly I don\'t mind the lack of apps anymore either. There\'s less clutter and distraction when I do use my phone, and because of that the battery life sticks out with me.By the way, I really enjoy the battery life on this thing. You can literally go full day on a full battery, which is pretty sweet. It also has a &#34;Battery Saving&#34; mode you can activate in settings, which will really really help someone out if they wanted to be more efficient in battery use.Ultimately, it depends on what exactly you\'re wanting in a phone, so maybe my review might not answer what you necessarily want. Either way, I know I initially didn\'t really think too much of this phone - I really didn\'t, but I\'m enjoying it more and more, and really hoping to see just how long this sturdy brick can last with me before I absolutely have to switch to another phone, or replace it, etc. Thanks for reading(:'),(447,'B00DRQ9500','I\'m using this on AT&T; around Dallas, Texas. I\'ve been switching between GSM and 3G because one gives me more bars in certain situations. It\'s replacing my Nokia Lumia 520 which I have used for a few months now, but am starting to get tired of all the carriers fighting about smartphone plans and wanted to get myself out of that mess by ditching mine and going on the GoPhone feature phone plans.And I really don\'t regret it.The phone itself is made out of this really nice and smooth premium plastic. It feels great in the hand. The keypad lights up and is very easy to use. The directional-pad is pretty good too. I really like that the MicroSD slot is on the side and not in the back like the 520. The charging port bugs me that it\'s on the top, but at least I can reuse my old one and have a backup.I haven\'t tried the camera yet, but the software has so many point-and-shoot like features. You can also actually shoot video much easier than the 520 (I still haven\'t found out how to without an extra app, heh).The Series 40 operating system is great. Really, really nice and robust for dumb phone software. The built-in productivity apps aren\'t all that fancy, but are very valuable once you start inputting the data. The best thing that you can push things to the SD card for easy exporting. You can easily add your own .jar apps by sending it to the phone via Bluetooth. It worked instantly with my Late 2011 MacBook Pro. Sonic Advance and Block Breaker 3 are two games I\'ve tried with it so far and they play nicely. Albite Reader works great for ePubs too, not that I plan on reading much on here, but it\'s good for some offline longform.I was also able to print to my Polaroid PoGo printer with it.Plugging in some headphones also gives you access to local radio. Unlike the 520, it lets you pull up the RDS, but it doesn\'t sound as good, even in stereo. It lets you record though.Call quality itself is very good too. I\'ve only called AT&T; this far in, but it sounded good!Overall I\'m pretty happy with it. I have a new 64GB iPod Touch I\'m going to use alongside it, so I\'m not going to miss too much.'),(448,'B00DRQ9500','It was a great phone while it lasted. The phone worked well, it was very high quality for a feature phone, and had plenty of apps that made it border on the realm of a semi-smart phone.However, five days into using it, I was notified that there was a system software update. It warned about using a high amount of bandwidth (1MB update), and recommended that the battery was over halfway charged. I made sure everything was fine and good to go. After the phone rebooted, a progressbar came on, finished, and then NOTHING. The phone doesn\'t turn on anymore, it gets recognized by my computers for about three seconds before it can\'t be detected (in a ROM mode no less), and even when it gets detected, all of Nokia\'s recovery programs fail to work.Overall it was a great phone for five days. I would have loved it had the thing been able to update properly. One more thing: You can\'t even update it via USB, the only way to update the phone is OTA (Over The Air). That seems like a serious issue.'),(449,'B00DRQ9500','This phone has 3g and basic email setup.

The pics are remarkable, much better than my Fuji Digital camera, and the video is in 1080 and flawless. There are several camera apps which are very helpful, a burst mode which chooses the best shot as well as others for more artistic shots. The camera saves each pic in two ways, 5 megapixels for instant upload and one in 34 megapixel. You can zoom in after the shot and not have that pixelated faded look, seeing is believing! Now the O S  is Windows, I have an Ipod Touch and a Android Tablet but this is fairly straight forward. There aren\'t nearly the Apps those others have BUT I have ALL the same ones I used on those other devices. For my cell service I use Consumer Cellar, 15 dollars a month for 200 minutes, I know that isn\'t a lot but as I said I bought this for the camera. I am one happy camper which is why I gave it 5 stars.'),(451,'B00E5M3JVG','I wasn\'t sure if I wanted a Windows phone.... I have had both iPhones and Androids with my latest phone being the Galaxy S4, which is a great phone.  However, after buying a laptop/tablet hybrid which had Windows 8 loaded I became more intrigued with the metro style of Windows.  Once you get used to it, I like it a lot.  Everything is fairly well integrated and you can easily move between programs and access programs quickly.  The live tiles are great, I just wish maybe they gave you another page instead of one big long page for the tiles.Now, this phone specifically is very snappy.  I really haven\'t had any lag and the photos taken by the phone are phenomenal.  I can quickly access the camera with a quick press/hold of the camera button and it is open and I am snapping photos fast.Cons:  The app store is a bit light on programs but that is improving daily.  Also, the back of the phone has the lens raised up a bit so it makes it a bit awkward to hold at certain angles.  A case I have on order should take care of that as many commenters regarding that product said it helped with this awkward feel.So, if you want a phone that is more customizable than an iphone and not as complicated as an Android - then a Windows phone is for you and I think the Lumia 1020 is the best one our there right now for this OS.

Lack of free apps or ones use is disappointing.no removable battery - I didn\'t think this would be an issue until I have tried to disconnect calls and had the phone freeze. It eventually unfreezes after about 5-10 seconds, but that seems like a long time when you\'re trying to hang up.Overall, I think it\'s an ok phone with an amazing camera. I really wanted it to be the perfect phone but sadly it falls short. But, if you don\'t mind the imperfections, the camera really does almost make up for the lackluster phone portion.On a side note, I love windows 8 on my computer, so this isn\'t an anti-microsoft review. I just don\'t find windows mobile up to par with android or apple.'),(453,'B00E5M3JVG','1st Day (5 stars)I watched many reviews trying to decide if to buy this phone.

So far, everything is GREAT.I will update this more as I use it but initial reaction and use is - love4th Day (3 stars)  After first use. I won\'t recommend another person to buy this phone because the sheer short battery life is just not worth it even though i\'ve employed all possible energy saving settings. I thought the app eco system wouldn\'t bother me that much, but it does. I have a big problem with Whatsapp and Push Notifications not working as well :/'),(454,'B00E5M3JVG','Lumia 1020 is \'A smart phone with the best digital camera available in the market\'. The pics are of amazingly of good resolution. Other than that, the smartphone does not have great features than can beat iphone or Samsung. If you are a big selfie, this would be an ideal phone. Sometimes, I give a second thought that if I bought a Camera or a smartphone. Some plus points of the phone that I found are below.The skydrive storage is very good as you need not store everything to your phone hence 32 GB ohnoe storage is more than what is required.The display is good and the resolution & touch sensitivity are very good.The battery is okay.The body of the phone is strong.The music player is delightful, you can download the songs from Nokia music store.The phone is designed to run in sync with Microsoft applications.'),(455,'B00E5M3JVG','This is an exceptional phone, easy to use, very intuitive and GREAT camera. However there are some drawbacks that I came to not like after 3 months of use, end recently sold the phone to get the iPhone 5s.Camera:The camera and the video recorder render great results, but it takes longer to get the camera open (even when using the side button) and to finally take a shot versus the iPhone. As a result I missed out on catching some moments while visiting my friends baby because the camera didn\'t open fast enough. I\'m not saying this is a drawback to not buy, but if you are not a photographer but more of a \'heat of the moment\' camera phone / Reddit user who posts funny shots, then you might miss out because of the lag.Also, someone mentioned the up-close shots not working. It\'s true. You can switch to macro and spend time adjusting settings, but problem is you can\'t get truly up close to an object. I was trying to shoot jewelry pics to share a photo of my engagement ring and I had to take shots from about 5 inches away and then crop them. Obviously this is just a small drawback because I should truly be using a DSLR if I need high quality macro shots. But I was disappointed. I actually went to a Microsoft store to get help using the camera and I still couldn\'t get up close shots to work correctly.Operating System:I bought this phone for the camera, but after 3 months I barely used it enough to warrant the change to Windows. I think the problem is I was spoiled with some great apps on the iPhone (native instagram app, Flipboard, educational apps). Instagram and Flipboard are finally releasing a Windows version but it won\'t be out until January 2014 (most likely). I used those apps daily and the substitute apps for instagram are just not as fluid and easy as the original.After a month, I was barely using the phone compared to my old iPhone 4s. It would just sit in my bag and I\'d take an occasional photo and just text message. I now realize just how much I wasn\'t utilizing it after switching back to iPhone.Music:Compared to the iPhone, the music setup on the Lumia 1020 is terrible. It\'s not intuitive, and if for instance you are listening to a song on your headphones or AUX cable in your vehicle, you need to turn up the volume considerably, but when you detach the cable the phone doesn\'t realize that you did this. It stays on full volume. Imagine getting a phonecall on 30/30 volume. The iPhone recognizes the changes automatically, so this was a drawback after a while since I use a AUX cable setup in my car.Gps/Directions:Best maps software period. Directions don\'t require data if you download them on home first via wi-fi. I would recommend this phone for heavy gps users / travelers.Various:It took me 2 months to figure out how to use \'linked inboxes\' so if you\'re struggling to use outlook, do yourself a favor and go online and watch a 2 minute video. The mail functions in this phone are unparalleled. Also, being able to edit microsoft word documents is great. It was another reason I bought the phone and I barely used to be honest, but it is GREAT when you need it.My brother has had windows phones since they first came out, swears by them, and loves them. He connects via his Xbox account and likes to keep everything within the same ecosystem from phone, computer, tablet, gaming. This is a wonderful aspect to Microsoft, much like the Apple ecosystem offers the iPad, Macbook, iPod, iPhone. I personally have all the those apple devices so it was hard to transition to using a Windows phone, where I can\'t transfer things as easily. There is a Windows Phone program you can download to your Mac Computer to easily transfer files, you can download via the Microsoft support site.Glitches:When resetting the phone to factory settings, it took 16 hours of spinning gears, multiple hard resets, until it let me setup the phone for the person I was selling to. 16 hours. I was disgusted. After reading the same problem online for other users, I realize that some phones take 30 minutes and one guy said it took him 24 hours to factory reset the phone. I thought I had bricked the device about 3 hours in, but low and behold it came back to life the morning after I started. This is unacceptable. Microsoft released a patch for this but you need to experience to fix it and I didn\'t take the time to. Frankly, I shouldn\'t have to for a 800$ phone.Overall:If you want a powerful camera on a phone, like windows 8, and don\'t mind less apps, this is the phone for you. If you are however in love with iOS and don\'t mind iOS7, then stick with iPhone and get the 5s. The camera isn\'t as great as the Lumia 1020, but for the casual user you won\'t notice the difference.'),(456,'B00E5M3JVG','The Nokia Lumina 1020 is the best Windows Phone there is. It is made with the newest and greatest hardware in advanced software.  It has 2 GB of ram. It has great resolution.the Nokia lumina is lightweight and very modern looking.I particularly enjoy the great variety of colors that you get to choose from.It looks very modern and sleek.The real treat of this phone is obviously the camera. It takes beautiful pictures and comes with great editing tools to make your pictures look even better.The audio and video on this phone is amazing! It really surprised me and how clear and detailed video was. I was extremely impressed.Also, I was extremely happy when I saw all the apps available from the Windows Phone Store.There are over 150,000 apps available. Of course,  there are some apps that they don\'t have that they have on Android and Apple. But they seem to be getting more apps all the time.I have been very happy with this phone. I highly recommend it, especially if you love a great camera with awesome video.'),(457,'B00E5M3JVG','This phone has so many great features, but most impressive is the camera. With the free Windows 8.1 update installed, Cortana is great and this phone is much more useful than an iPhone. Despite people bemoaning the lack of a specific app here and there, I was able to find all of the apps I wanted for the phone in the Store with one exception. For that, Internet Explorer worked fine accessing the same functionality via the Web. I also found the battery life to be exceptional and lasting for 12 hours. GPS navigation will suck the battery like it did on the 920 before it, but unlike the 920, I was surprised that this model did *not* have built-in inductive charging. I don\'t like having a $50 case on the phone, so I\'ve opted to plug it in. This is my only disappointment with this model, but Windows Phone has come a long way and is equal to or better than other phone operating systems. I loved using this with Xbox One\'s Smartglass application, and Cortana is actually helpful, aside from the standard witty responses. Since there\'s no inductive charging, this only gets an A- rating.'),(458,'B00F59AGH8','OK,I have to be honest, I bought the phone for the camera and I have not been disappointed; it\'s great!I\'ve taken pictures of city skylines at night while in a plane, actively landing. Both the focal point and the \'pinpoints\' of  light on the ground came out crisp and clear.I\'ve taken \'closeups\' of people that look ~90% as good as a professional, posed photo.The camera is so fast that it captures \'split second\' motion w great detailSince I travel alot for work I can take stunning travel photos without having to lug around a regular camera.The phone functioning gets about 3-1/2 to 4 stars; sometimes the sound is not great and conversations are muffled.on the ther hand, the \'smart phone\' functions surpass the iPhone( I have the 5S as a work phone) due to the absolute \'lightning fast speed! also, interface looks better.....'),(459,'B00G4DTR0G','I can already tell I would love this phone, but since I\'m on Verizon, and since AT&T; seems to have exclusivity on this phone, I won\'t be able to use one until a Verizon version comes out.  This is nuts.  I want the phone I want, but I don\'t want to deal with AT&T;\'s horrible service to use what is sure to be a phantasy phone.  Unlike some phone users, I like weight and size.  To me, weight is like quality.  It may be a delusion, but a hefty phone feels solid and it just gives me the sense that I\'m not playing with something that\'s a cheaply designed toy, but a reliable phone/tablet/phablet combo.  And, of course, size is just great for readability.  I don\'t want both a phone AND a tablet, so a large phone like the 1520 is exactly what I want, but cannot have.I hate exclusivity, especially when the one who get the exclusive rights to a product is the one I\'m not going to do business with.'),(460,'B00G4DTR0G','This is my first Windows phone, and I have switched from Android. I really like the phone.Con:I wish it would respond faster, especially when I rotate the device. I\'m also looking forward to their app store to get up to date. I can\'t get Snapchat to work, and several other apps are missing. I also don\'t get notifications from Facebook/Messenger.Pros:Battery life is AMAZING! The camera is great. Setting up new e-mail accounts was a breeze. There will probably be more pros and cons, but I\'ve only had the phone for 3 days so I\'m still figuring it out.'),(461,'B00G4DTR0G','Never had a Windows phone before.  When I first got it, I was frustrated by the inability to send pictures directly to a printer.  But, as I continued to use it, I\'m in love!  It is huge for a phone, but with my vision, it helps to be able to see things!  I\'ve learned the new Windows OS quickly, and love it also!  Just wish there were more apps for it.  I hope Microsoft is working on that.  They have a good product here.  The pictures and video is amazing, and the Nokia Creative Studio makes it so easy and fun to edit pictures on the fly and send them to family and friends quickly.  Found out that I can connect it to my macbook and it automatically uploads my pics.  Problem solved!'),(462,'B00G4DTR0G','Six months ago I purchased my first Apple, an iPad mini with AT&T; LTE.  I\'ve grown somewhat tired of its operating system...one designed to be workable for any IQ above room temperature.  Because of Apple\'s aversion to menus, icons, and especially the Back Button, one is forced to use animal-like gestures to accomplish the most elementary functions.  The fact that it works perfect almost all the time makes it worthwhile, of course.I\'m completely avoiding anything with the words Android or gmail attached to it for security reasons.  It is by far the most hackable platform around, and even if nothing extraordinary occurs, you\'ve still got Google looking over your shoulder 24/7.  For the unaware, Google promises to:  Read your emails and extract any information they please; Track and record your physical movements and sell the information to the highest bidder; and take possession of all documents, pictures, videos and music left on their server for more than six months.So that leaves us with Blackberry and Windows phones.  Both Verizon and AT&T; make it pretty clear they are not interested in selling Blackberries these days.  AT&T; has a good selection of Nokias (now a captive manufacturer for Windows) and the 1520 has a gorgeous 6&#34; screen.  This screen has 2,000,000 pixels, compared to about 700,000 for an iPad mini or an iPhone 5.  I love to read newspapers online, and this allows me to read the full page edition.  it was bit disconcerting at first...the text was not always a suitable size when I turned to an article.  But then, after a couple of days, the machine adapted to my newspapers and the text appeared the right size.I had hoped to connect a bluetooth keyboard, but the 1520 will not accept one.  The virtual keyboard is quite good, in part because the pressure-sensitive touch screen is superior to Samsung\'s temp-sensitive screen.  You can use gloved fingers and/or stylus.  The predictive text is good, and adapts to your vocabulary.  It has voice dictation, which took some getting used to.  Hint: think before you speak, and pause after each sentence.The camera is one of the best.  And like the best cameras, it snaps the picture about a second after you press the button.  The iPad does not have this delay, and its pictures are noticeably inferior.  It take alot of persistence to take pictures of a fast-moving dog.The battery life is superb.  It will easily go two days between charges.  Compare this to the iPad mini, which must remain connected for several hours each day, and doesn\'t actually increase its charge until you stop using the LTE.  (with the supplied 1A charger)The &#34;Live Tiles&#34; of the home screen are not particularly attractive, and no wallpaper is available.  But that is my most substantial complaint so far.  I\'ve had this phone for a week now, and I look forward to importing files from my Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 laptops....something that the iPad does not like to do.'),(463,'B00G4DTR0G','I got to play with a Nokia Lumia 1520 over past few days and it has blown me away. I have used so many phones/OS that I am fascinated by the diversity of ecosystem. I have used HTC Titan, some previous Lumia series  and past Windows Mobile series. After dabbling with iOS, webOS, WM, I have settled on a Android as a primary phone. Nokia Lumia series is elegantly designed. The 1520 is just gorgeous.I am interested in the specs of Lumia from following parameters. phone: size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR ratingNokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)In my opinion, following are key specs to consider. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don&#8217;t advertize or mention SAR prominently.The things that pop out is the screen size and the external storage capability. Obviously weight is a downside. The windows phone 8 operating system has matured to a large extent and most of common apps are available. It does still lag its distant cousins iOS and Android. But Nokia has given a splendid hardware. My experience of using camera (one of the best cameras in the smartphone and a key differentiator), navigation, reading articles, books, listening to music, watching videos were flawless. I highly recommend to anyone interested in windows platform. This phone is something to definitely checkout!As for a comparative analysis I have laid the specs of other top 2014 phones.

everything that the box listed as it contents.'),(372,5,39,'The only reason that I did not return it was because I live in the Caribbean so when I calculated the cost to return it, I decided to keep it.'),(373,0,40,'I got my first GSM qwerty phone for free when I renewed my contract in 2010.'),(374,1,40,'It was a touchscreen Samsung with a slide-out keyboard.'),(375,2,40,'Because the phone

has far better FM reception than the Samsung or Alcatel; the battery lasts WAY longer than my past phones; the menu system is natural, better designed, and faster than the touchscreens; the keypad is easy to see and has a very good touch; the screen quality is bright and clear; and the phone STAYS locked when you lock it.'),(384,11,40,'WiFi is easy and fast, and I remain happy not to spend an extra $30 per month (PLUS data plan cost) to have a smart phone.Two teensy cons for me with this phone, both cheaply resolved:(1) The back of body of this solidly built phone is slick.'),(385,12,40,'I don\'t want the phone falling out of my breast pocket or my hand so I ordered from Amazon \"Amzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case for Nokia C3 - Black by Amzer\" for about $10.'),(386,13,40,'The case slips on perfectly and keeps the phone comfortably secure while I am on a call; and it keeps the phone in one place no matter where I put it down.'),(387,14,40,'It also muffles the Nokia\'s enthusiastic vibration when I want to be alerted to a call or text but don\'t want to buzz the desktop.'),(388,15,40,'(2) The sound quality of the comfortable and ergonomically well-designed earbuds is muffled-sounding.'),(389,16,40,'So I simply substitute the original earbuds from an old iPod.'),(390,17,40,'They are sufficient for providing the Nokia\'s superior FM reception and they sound better than the Nokia buds.When my cell phone contract comes up in a couple of months I will take a free phone if I can get the little Samsung ruggedized waterproof phone for when I\'m camping or fishing.'),(391,18,40,'But I will keep using the Nokia C3-00 as my primary phone beause it is perfect for my normal pattern of phone usage.'),(392,0,41,'this phone has what they call a \"POWERSAVER\"

ear.'),(398,1,42,'The Wi-Fi connectivity is nice and works well, I\'ve used it both at home and in a hotel room.'),(399,2,42,'The internet browser is surprisingly fast but the memory fills up very

customize (some) button functions and on-screen shortcuts.'),(405,0,43,'Since I was due for an early upgrade on my plan, I checked around in the AT&T; store for non-smartphone messaging-only options

to see what options existed in third party unlocked phones.'),(410,5,43,'The Nokia C3-00 caught my eye largely because it looked very much like my previous QWERTY bar phone, but it also had FM stereo and Wifi capability which had the potential to dramatically improve its day-to-day flexibility.'),(411,6,43,'In addition, user reviews across multiple internet review sites gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews.Before purchase I had some initial concerns about whether or not AT&T; would identify the phone on their network as a smartphone since it uses the Symbian S40 operating system.'),(412,7,43,'AT&T; said the phone\'s IMEI number is not among their list of smartphone IMEI\'s.'),(413,8,43,'I\'ve gone through my first billing cycle and can confirm no forced smartphone data

the box from day one.'),(415,10,43,'No problems at all.Battery life is typically 3-4 days between charges with moderate texting and several hours of daily FM stereo usage at work.'),(416,11,43,'Better than expected.Wifi works OK, not very speedy, but it does enable access to personal email and MSNBC/CNN at Starbucks.'),(417,12,43,'Just don\'t expect an iPhone-type browsing experience.'),(420,15,43,'Note: If you DO opt for a data plan for this phone, bear in mind that it\'s an EDGE phone, not a 3G phone, so your data transfer speeds under a paid data plan will likely be a little underwhelming.FM stereo works super and is a nice inclusion on a phone at this price level.'),(421,16,43,'Earphone cord acts as the antenna and must be plugged in for reception.'),(422,17,43,'Sounds great, and again, better than expected.Keyboard is typical QWERTY layout.'),(423,18,43,'I found the tactile feedback quite pleasant and was easier to text on it than previous phone.Call quality is very good.'),(425,20,43,'I can hear callers loud and clear and they can hear me the same.Nothing bothersome about the texting experience.'),(426,21,43,'It has a conversation mode similar to other phones and it works well.'),(427,22,43,'Only complaint is that individual texts within a conversation will only display the first two lines of the text.'),(429,24,43,'Not terribly annoying, but adds an extra step to the texting process.'),(430,25,43,'I suppose you have to accept some compromises when working with a 2.4 in display screen.Overall, I\'d have have to say this has been a terrific phone choice for me.'),(431,26,43,'At $99, it\'s priced very well, offers expanded feature content and NO DATA PLAN requirement.'),(432,27,43,'It\'s a worthy option to similar carrier-provided messaging phones and a great value.'),(433,0,44,'Firstly, it\'s a great price for an unlocked phone that can be used with AT&T;, TMobile, prepaid, and any other GSM (SIM card) service providers worldwide.'),(434,1,44,'I\'m not going to repeat the technical specifications.'),(435,2,44,'It is very light, portable and has excellent battery

makes a decent gift.I would recommend it over any carrier branded phone.'),(440,7,44,'It is always cheaper in the long run to get an unsubsidized phone.'),(441,0,45,'When you first pick up the Nokia C3, you can think that you have a modern looking full QWERTY Blackberry.'),(442,1,45,'It is a cool looking phone, with a very easy to use keyboard.Its light weight, so it dosent feel heavy in your pocked, has great battery life.'),(444,3,45,'Its not a high end camera phone, but its pictures are just as clear as my old 8900.It dosent compare with the high end smart phones like the new Blackberries or HTC androids, but for the $160 range that its in, it certainly gives you that expensive look, and is a great email/messaging device.'),(445,0,46,'I love this phone because of the easy to use QWERTY keyboard.I always call it a wanna be smart phone!This is only the second cell phone I have ever owned...my first one was a Samsung flip phone without a camera.If you are looking for a fancy phone then buy one, this is just a nice phone with some nice extras.I love that I can do facebook, email and surf the net at home or in hot spots.It saves a lot of money because you do not have to lock in to an expensive phone plan if you are just looking for a replacement phone....I just used this to replace my old phone.However, what I don\'t like about the phone is that it isn\'t always user friendly, and if you are technically challenged like I am it can get a bit frustrating at times to figure out what you are doing.Luckily, if you go to the nokia site you will find a great discussion board where people can give you solutions about how to use this and that option or any problem that come up.The mannual that comes with the phone is useless.I have also called nokia customer service with some questions, and they have been helpful.I must warn that when it says \"US Version\", it really means that it is an international phone with an American adaptor.I didn\'t like this because I thought I was getting a US phone.The seller sent me free of charge an original nokia US charger, I am pleased that he offered to do that.But, the charger cord is a little short which can make it difficult to talk on while it is charging.Words like color are colour, favorite is favourite...so uses British English.That doesn\'t bother me so much, though.The apps aren\'t great, but I don\'t really use apps anyway.The numbers are hard to find, but all in all you get used to the quirks and realize that you have a lot for the money.The camera isn\'t bad, but the video is really short.Just not as users friendly as I thought it would be, but I would buy it again simply because of internet access, and the QWERTY key pad is easy to use.I love texting on this phone, but I had a problem with sending and receiving photos.Found out the phone has to be programmed, and you have to either call nokia or find an answer on the Nokia discussion board.Don\'t be afraid to buy...especially if you know a lot about cell phones or if you have someone who can help you figure it out.My engineer husband helped me get it all set up, but I am still trying to figure out some of the technical issues.Sweet little phone for the price.'),(446,0,47,'So despite some of the negative reviews I still decided to buy the phone and I was disappointed with this purchase.'),(448,2,47,'I have been a loyal SE customer for many years and since my C905a broke, I thought why not give another brand a try?'),(450,4,47,'Maybe it\'s because I\'ve gotten so used to them but I think their UI is just more user friendly.'),(451,5,47,'However, I have gotten use to this phone and I do like it.'),(452,6,47,'I love the fact that it has a lot of smartphone features.'),(454,8,47,'I don\'t have to

seconds.'),(460,17,47,'I knew the phone didn\'t have one but I didn\'t realize how much I would miss it!'),(461,18,47,'I like to listen to music while I\'m doing other stuff on the phone.'),(462,19,47,'There\'s no way to skip to the next song or change the station or adjust the volume other than quitting the application you\'re doing and going back to your media player.'),(464,21,47,'I do have my phone settings like ringtones and such set to files on my SD card.'),(465,22,47,'And everytime I would take the card out and put it back in, my settings would be

Symbian^3 may not yet be many, but so far this hasn\'t been an issue for me at all.I also got the Nokia CC-1005 silicone cover for my phone, it\'s hard to find, but it fits great, protects the phone

traditionally been about lowering their AT&T; phone bills.'),(2068,10,154,'Many in Silicon Valley, including Steve Jobs, grew up with this mentality.'),(2069,11,154,'Nokia probably realize this and gives you a choice...the press is not giving Nokia the credit for giving you the freedom.- Nokia N8 robust hardware will still be handy after many years of use and software updates.Part of the \"UI problem\" is due to the less tightly structured Symbian UI development kit, by allowing 3rd party developers the freedom to create their own look and feel.So each app on Symbian can have a different UI structure and user\'s experience may not very be consistent across different apps even though they are using the same device (N8).The less tight structure of Symbian APIs has proved to be a strength as Symbian has evolved to support a much larger variety of hardware types with different phone form factors:- some touch screen- some T9 keypad- some qwerty keypadNokia, as a leading phone manufacturer, offers a larger choice of phone form factors for a larger customer base...that\'s the reason Nokia is a leading phone manufacturer.Each form factor will be preferred by different types of users, since there is a much wider consumer base.Many business users will prefer a qwerty keyboard.Many users will prefer a T9 keypad and find the qwerty keyboard a distraction with too many buttons...for example, they usually do not do a lot of texting or type on a computer keyboard.Many people like the \"feel\" of a touch UI...but that also means that each app is more likely to have \"touch buttons\" on a different location of the screen.That means touch UI phones require the users to \"look before you touch\".That means with the keyboard or keypad, users can \"feel\" as they \"touch\" the phone buttons without looking.'),(2070,0,155,'This phone has some incredible features at this unlocked, off contract price.'),(2071,1,155,'This is a 3G pentaband WORLD phone which will

weeks ago and I\'ve been playing around with it since.'),(2587,1,192,'In my opinion, this is the BEST Nokia phone to date.'),(2588,2,192,'Now, before reading any further, I\'ll give some background information about me so whoever is reading this can possibly relate and continue reading OR not relate and move onto another review:- I\'m a male, age 25-30.- Consider myself pretty technologically savvy (career is in IT).- Previous phones: Motorola Razr, then Nokia N95 8GB, and now Nokia N8.- Originally purchased an iPhone 4 16GB, but didn\'t like the feel of the phone in my hand (Nokia N8 has a better feel), and was not fond of the simplicity of the iPhone 4.- I like being somewhat different and not having a phone that the majority have (although if everybody started buying an N8 now, I wouldn\'t sell mine and get another kind).- Live in Canada (had a friend bring this over for me) and use this with Rogers Wireless and it works great!So here\'s a breakdown of what I like and don\'t like about the Nokia N8.What I LIKE about the:Camera- 12 megapixel camera takes great quality pictures!'),(2589,3,192,'You can do normal view and also take widescreen shots.- There\'s a Nokia Panaroma app that stitches together pictures for you!'),(2590,4,192,'Great for taking landscape pictures!- HD recording is amazing--the video and sound recorded is surprising.- There\'s a built-in lens cover that automatically opens up and closes unlike my N95.- Built-in image editing (i.e.'),(2591,5,192,'no need for a Fat Booth app--you can edit yourself and edit even more things!'),(2592,6,192,')- Looking at pictures and watching video is great on the screen.Call Quality- Crystal clear.'),(2593,7,192,'Didn\'t have a problem with N95, and same goes for Nokia N8Keyboard/Texting- Despite other people complaining about a lack of a qwerty keyboard in portrait mode, I actually prefer the numeric keypad using T9.'),(2594,8,192,'The buttons are bigger, so it\'s easier for one-handed texting.Homescreen- 3 customizable homescreens.'),(2595,9,192,'I use 2 though--one for apps, and one to see a list of my e-mails from Gmail and Hotmail, my notes/reminders, and the music player.Music Player- Very easy to use, FM transmitter works great.Syncing Contacts/Calendar- I was able to sync my google contacts and calendar using Mail for Exchange.Gorilla Glass Screen- My girlfriend prematurely took off the screen protector that came with the phone, and I freaked out thinking it would get imperfected before I got a chance to put on a different screen protector.'),(2596,10,192,'Now, I\'m actually considering not putting anything on it at all.'),(2597,11,192,'There has been no scratches--anything and everything that has gotten on it was able to get wiped off.Maps/GPS- Free maps and navigation for life!'),(2598,12,192,'GPS finds my location very quickly.- Ovi Maps is great and is constantly improving.'),(2599,13,192,'They teamed up with TripAdvisor to give you a feature that will provide information on restaurants, shopping, sights, etc based on your location on the GPS---so you can read reviews of things that are close to you!Battery- I charged it fully before using and then discharged it fully for the second usage.- Takes about 2 hours on an empty battery to a full charge.- I was able to get 2 full days of moderately heavy usage on the phone before the battery ran out.- Now I try to keep the battery charged up as much as possible to maintain its life.What I DISLIKE about the:Call Quality- The other person on the other line sometimes reports hearing their own voice speaking, but I can\'t conclude whether this is the fault of the phone, or the wireless service, because it has happened just a few times.Vibration- Okay, well this isn\'t really a problem anymore, but I know other users have complained that when the phone is on silent/pager mode, the vibration when getting a text message is to quick and weak.'),(2600,14,192,'Well that\'s because the default \"Ringing Type\" setting is set of OFF.'),(2601,15,192,'You need to set it to \"BEEP ONCE\" and you\'ll get a nice long vibration alerting you of your incoming text messages.Music- There\'s not button on the sides to go control your music (I\'m used to having accessible buttons like the N95), but it\'s not that big of an issue for me.Maps/GPS- There is no overview of all the turns/roads you need to take to reach your destination, which I\'m sure (hopefully) they will add in a future update.Apps- Lots of people complain about the lack of apps, and so do I.'),(2602,16,192,'But this phone is still new, and I\'m looking forward to more and more development of different apps for it.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.'),(2603,17,192,'I got what I wanted in a phone with lots of customization, great camera, and great build quality to last for some time.'),(2605,0,193,'I just recieved a Orange N8 (3/31/2011) that was victim to the AMOLED \"Purple\" screen issue, this may mean there is a bad batch in the Amazon warehouse.'),(2608,3,193,'On a lighter note, this was to be my second N8, it may not be the pretiest UI but is definatley does the most of any smart phone I have owned, and i have had my fare share (2.2 Froyo, iOS4, S60, S40) If you are looking for a dependable \"Do anything\" device this is it, If you are loking for constant fun, look elseware.'),(2609,4,193,'If it is photo and video that you love, look no further and hit the \"add to cart\" button.'),(2611,1,194,'No four G holds it back and sadly Nokia will drop  Symbian in the near future.'),(2612,2,194,'That being said I love this phone it does everything I need it to do quite well.'),(2613,3,194,'Battery life is very good, reception is above average and and it\'s rugged.'),(2614,4,194,'It\'s been dropped onto concrete from six foot up a few times and could care less.'),(2615,5,194,'Screen is small by the standard of today\'s phones but find it readable in bright sunlight.'),(2618,9,194,'and wanting to keep you on the  &#34;farm&#34;  But some specific apps  for say your bank and such are just not available and won\'t be.'),(2619,10,194,'And download a different browser Nokia\'s is a tad slow.'),(2620,11,194,'Anyhow bottom line is I\'m  keeping this thing until it just won\'t work any more I like it that much!'),(2621,12,194,'Unfortunately I will leave Nokia after this phone as do not wish to be forced to a windows phone and not going to android or ios  either.'),(2623,15,194,'If you can live with some limitations this is a great phone.'),(2624,0,195,'For this amazing price, the HTC Desire was the android comparison I looked at before I purchased the N8.'),(2625,1,195,'So much bashing has taken place concerning Nokia\'s symbian - but mainly from \"review sites\".'),(2626,2,195,'Actual owners hardly have anything negative to say.'),(2627,3,195,'Having used both, I cant say which one is \"better\" as there are pros and cons to each, and each person has their own preference.'),(2628,4,195,'Like other decisions, this one involves trade offs that the buyer must make.'),(2629,5,195,'I chose the N8 because: Solid construction, gorilla glass, 12MP camera, HD video, FM transmitter, HDMI & TV out, 16GB storage, bluetooth 3.0, Nokia legendary reliability and the battery last days (not hours).'),(2630,6,195,'If you are willing to forgo all these for the android experience, that\'s personal preference.'),(2631,7,195,'In my opinion a pretty UI is not everything and Symbian ^3 is fast and responsive!'),(2632,8,195,'Bottom line is the N8 is value for money (the camera alone is worth the price!).'),(2633,9,195,'Just one more point for those who may have an \"issue\" with their phone - TRY UPDATING THE FIRMWARE!'),(2634,0,196,'As a previous owner of other rival phones (e.g.- iPhone, Android, Blackberry), I am extremely satisfied with the overall performance of Nokia\'s new arrival, the N8.'),(2635,1,196,'After a week of use, I find myself being continuously impressed and rarely disappointed.'),(2636,2,196,'Its most stand-out feature, of course, being the beefy 12 MP Carl Zeiss camera.'),(2637,3,196,'The capabilities and features embodied in this addition rival most stand-alone digital cameras.'),(2638,4,196,'The editing tools and other options, via apps and widgets pertaining to the camera, just add to the already impressive capabilities of the hardware.Also, the Cymbian^3 OS is an improvement from previous Nokia OSs and it is way ahead of its competitors in terms of stability and overall function.'),(2639,5,196,'Most surprising is the ease at which the phone can be navigated and settings can be modified.'),(2640,6,196,'Like with most open-source phones, every ounce of memory and seemingly limitless control is at the user\'s fingertips.'),(2641,7,196,'The interface is very easy-to-use and Nokia provides many useful tips in the form of notifications, which can be disabled if necessary, to inform the user about some capabilities that may be passing them by.Going back to hardware, the phone has a number of convenient attributes.'),(2642,8,196,'The scratch-resistant, and nearly damage-proof, gorilla glass screen is something all phones should consider using in the future.'),(2643,9,196,'This is one of the few phones that manages to combine durability and responsiveness, without making any sacrifices.'),(2644,10,196,'The HDMI and mini-USB jacks are a wonderful addition as well when you consider the opportunities they provide.I could continue to praise every little thing about this phone, but I should conclude with a few notable shortcomings.'),(2645,11,196,'Most apparent, especially for those who previously owned an iPhone or Android phone, would be the severe lack of apps on the Ovi store.'),(2646,12,196,'Those users interested in frivolous, time-wasting apps will not be satisfied with the currently destitute app store.'),(2647,13,196,'Although many of the apps and widgets available are not geared toward fun as much as function, previous users of those app-rich phones might feel lost in the world of Nokia.'),(2648,14,196,'Another downfall is the standard web browser for the N8.'),(2649,15,196,'Its clunky, non-responsive operations seem out of place in the phone\'s otherwise efficient OS.'),(2650,16,196,'Fortunately, Nokia is aware of this issue and it is something that can easily be improved via a simple update.'),(2651,17,196,'Finally, like many phones of its kind, battery life may prove to be a hindrance.'),(2652,18,196,'It is difficult to say that the battery life of the N8 is any worse than any of its competitors and users can easily figure out ways of improving battery life.'),(2653,19,196,'I only note this because I have been led to believe, by several reviews, that this phone boasted an extremely long battery life, while what I am experiencing is average at best.In closing, I can honestly say that this is the best phone that I have ever used in terms of overall capability, reliability, and durability.'),(2654,20,196,'Those of you looking for the next big thing, deciding between the iPhone or Android, or even just looking to try something new, I implore you to give the Nokia N8 a shot.'),(2657,1,197,'great camera, very fast connecting GPS

it will freeze, or refuse to open new apps.'),(2661,5,197,'it also hangs while opening some apps, or the touch screen buttons stop working.'),(2662,6,197,'for the life of me, i can not transfer the music onto this phone.'),(2663,7,197,'it should be as simple as finding the music on the memory card (that was in my nokia 5800)  but it can not find that music.'),(2664,8,197,'last night, i put the music onto the phone  directly, and after scanning for 8 hours, it found 10 sounds.the battery life is horrible.'),(2665,9,197,'the phone is trying to do to much, and it drains the battery.'),(2666,10,197,'for example, it is constantly trying to connect to the internet (or scans for it),  it is constantly turning on the GPS feature to tell you your location, and current temp in the city (or area of the city) you are in.i would say the battery life is about 6 hours, even on power saving mode, it is only about 2 days.games are unstable, they often freeze.the speakers that are built inside the phone sound horrible.'),(2667,11,197,'compare the sound quality to the Nokia 5800, and these speakers sound like headphone speakers that are turned up way to loud.'),(2668,12,197,'the 5800 had more then 1 speaker, and sounded great.also, please note that this is just not my phone.'),(2669,13,197,'many people are complaining about this on Nokia\'s official forums, and we are waiting for a more stable update to come out to fix the operating system.'),(2670,14,197,'all phones with this operating systems are reporting similar problems (c6, n8, and e7, 97)once they fix that, it will

owned a lot of top smartphones, so I figured I would highlight what I find excels and what lags current crop.'),(2676,4,198,'Overall it is a very good phone.Pros:Camera - The camera is pretty much perfect.'),(2677,5,198,'You can tell they put a lot of time into it because the software works well and the pictures are great.'),(2678,6,198,'There simply is no better camera out there on a phone.Construction - This is a very attractive, and study phone.'),(2679,7,198,'I have no doubt it will last a long time, it is very nicely engineeredBattery Life - Battery lasts longer than any other smartphone I have used.Memory-  People criticise the lack of ram, but I have not run out of ram ever, and actually having more ram wastes battery.Radios - Pentaband phone, not very common.'),(2680,8,198,'This will work everywhere on earth pretty much.Navigation - Free, no data connection needed and works very well.'),(2682,10,198,'Syncs fast and works even without view of sky.Sports Tracker - It is awesome!OMAP processor - Do not listen to MHZ junkies, this processor is very nice because it handlesConnectivity - This phone is the first one I have ever had that switches between Wifi, 3G etc seemlessly and shuts off data when phone not in use.'),(2683,11,198,'Very well done.HDMI out/video - works well and default player plays nearly any format you throw at it.'),(2684,12,198,'even MKV files.ConsWeb Browser - After using the maemo browser on n900 I realize how good mobile browsing should be.'),(2686,14,198,'I know they are coming out with update, but that is no excuse, should ship with good browserOn screen keyboard - It is terrible, Opera mini did it right on N8 why can nokia not do it.Screen - The resolution is relatively low for modern smart phones.'),(2687,15,198,'It looks very nice, but when you view pages zoomed out text is garbled due to lack of resolution.'),(2688,16,198,'I have pretty good vision so I like to read tiny text rather than zoom in.UI - Symbian is a perfectly fine OS, but the UI is inconsistent.'),(2689,17,198,'Some areas you hit enter to have setting go, some you have to hit check then ok, some menus go away when you touch shaded part etc.'),(2692,1,199,'The first phone was delivered dead on arrival and I returned it.'),(2693,2,199,'I got soon a replacement phone which worked fine for one day and it started to

had to wait until it randomly started to work again.'),(2695,4,199,'The third replacement unit works well.I believe my review tells quite much same stories than everybody else; the 12 megapixel camera

outstanding- perfect sync with Gmail, google calendar and google contacts.The problems:- The HDMI cover cracked before I even used, this is apparently a common problem with N8.- ovi store and apps

do it manually- I gave up fixing/finding the MTP driver with windows 7 64bit- I\'m annoyed that skype video does not exist for symbian.OLD REVIEWFirst off, I got it cheaper here so price/quality cannot be beaten compared to many smart phones.What I like:- Penta band 3.5 G connection: I\'m on T-mobile in the U.S.(1700 / 2100Mhz), I have to switch to European bands (1900/2100) from time to time, and my country uses 850/2100 Mhz.- The camera: With this phone\'s Carl Zeiss lens (with 12 Megapixel ccd) I don\'t need a point and shoot camera in my pocket.- USB on the go: you can plug in USB flash drives and transfer files.'),(3545,4,266,'I attached Sandisk multi-card reader and it works...- HDMI out: one of my DVD encoded documentary was 1.7 Gb; I thought it would not play but it was smooth...perfect.- The Fm receiver/ transmitter: I bought the car charger (Nokia D4) just for this.'),(3546,5,266,'Now I play my music through fm radio transmitter.- The music player is a little \"wanna be\" apple\'s cover flow but it\'s good.- OVI map and voice guidance is excellent.'),(3547,6,266,'I would rank it higher than Tom Tom\'s services besides it is free and does not require data coverage.- Full Office set: quickoffice, file manager, pdf reader, even a zip manager for free.- I can download any file, and send them as e-mail attachments- True multitasking, no question!'),(3548,7,266,'(OVI map on + music on + transmitting through fm radio + wifi tethering)Some critics:- I think Symbian^3 interfaces are smooth, way better than the previous S60 but can be improved a lot.'),(3549,8,266,'It is NOT snappy feel like iOS but good enough.- Symbian has less support and that is Nokia\'s responsibility especially now that they are moving away from its openness.'),(3550,9,266,'On top of that windows mobile will be the next platform.- Voice command is not that good...web browser sucks, although there are some good implementation in app forms (eg \"AP news\" or \"Accuweather\")- Symbian OS takes a learning curve.'),(3551,10,266,'If you expect something that just works and easy...you will be frustrated.- Switching between wifi and 3G connection and automatic turn on and off are sometimes problematic.My recommendation:Use Opera mobile instead of the nokia\'s web browserAPPS: Install internet radio, big screen for HDMI, Joikuspot for a 3g to WiFi

fast.'),(3553,12,266,'When pairing with windows 7, make sure it does not automatically connect and backup, I experienced many crashes.If you use windows 7 64bit to pair with the N8\'s Bluetooth, I

N8.'),(3570,7,268,'Below are my pro\'s and con\'s:Cons:- doesn\'t use android so there are not a lot of apps, games etcPros:- super amazing picture taking quality- Zennon flash revealing true colors not that blue LED color of all other smart phone pictures- tight tight sealed package, I dropped this phone into a sink full of water it sat submerged for 30 seconds it worked fine when retrieved no damage at all- battary charges incredibly fast using nokia charging port vs mini USB port charges 100% in 30 minutes- full office type software; word, excel, ppt- huge standard memory- FM RF transmitter can play music directly to any radio, use it all the time when on trips using rental cars- map software GPS doesn\'t require data connect, when traveling abroad I don\'t have to worry about data charges- wifi hot spot is amazing, it works well with Joikuspot, my cell service requires wifi tethering charges but this phone being unlocked gets around this.'),(3571,8,268,'As long as whatever computer, ipad etc your using to access the web through the wifi hotspot appears to be mobile device your provider will not block it.- Has DLNA capability I can share videos and pictures wirelessly on my home network with one touch- essential applications are available for sharing amazing pictures and videos, Dropbox, Facebook, twitter etc...'),(3572,0,269,'Nokia N8 is a great phone for I\'ve had one in the past and was bought here on Amazon but from a different seller.'),(3573,1,269,'Nokia Sealed box, everything 100% OK.Just bought 2 Nokia\'s N8 from Omnitel believing their Nokia\'s N8 were also as previous i had bought through other seller, but came to find out that they were not, as the boxes weren\'t nokia sealed, missing HDMI cables, damaged USB cable, camera doesn\'t work on one of them.'),(3574,2,269,'After these issues seller hasn\'t helped in anyway to solve problems.'),(3575,3,269,'Went to Nokia care center only to find out that these phones sold by Omnitel are CHINESE and therefore no waranty on them as Omnitel claims they have as they claim also that they are US versions which aren\'t.'),(3577,0,270,'I bought this phone from Amazon, a week back and I own a Nokia N900 too.'),(3578,1,270,'I wish to compare these two, as Nokia N900 is one of the greatest phones from Nokia.1)  First let me go to internet browsing.Nokia N900 is the first phone to have full flash player and the major capability is it will play videos directly in the browser, for sites like youtube, facebook etc.'),(3579,2,270,'Once facebook moved to latest flash player, N900 is not able to play the videos(eventhough there is a hack).Nokia N8, does not have full flash player, but it has flash lite.'),(3580,3,270,'I was expecting that the youtube and facebook will not be able to play the videos directly in the browser.'),(3581,4,270,'To my surprise, both the sites played the video in the site itself, thats really great.With respect to Nokia N900, every site determines it as a computer and hence will show the full page, instead of the mobile site, which is good, if the wifi or 3G is really good.With respect to Nokia N8, every site determines it as a mobile and hence will first display the mobile site, but if you re-route it to the full site, still it displays the sites like charm.Conclusion: with respect to internet browsing Nokia N8 does great.2)  Playing videos.Nokia N900 has a resolution of 800x480, hence the videos look very good.Nokia N8 has a resolution of 640x360, so I expected videos(good videos like HD videos) will look less attractive, but to my surprise, it looks great in Nokia N8.Nokia N900 can almost play any video format directly, like wmv, avi etc, including flv.'),(3582,5,270,'I am not sure whether any other phone can do/compete with this.Nokia N8 on the other hand, has the ability to play any video format, but for avi and flv there is a little trick.'),(3583,6,270,'When you copy an avi file, your PC may complain that this device is not capable to play it, but you can still use it as a storage and say yes to it.'),(3584,8,270,'For .flv files, after you copy, the media player is not going to pick it, as if it doesn\'t support it.'),(3585,9,270,'If you go to file manager and click on this .flv file, media player picks it and plays well.'),(3586,10,270,'I haven\'t tried .mkv file yet, as the mkv files that I have are all big and it is not allowing me to copy those.Conclusion: Playing videos is very good in Nokia N8.3)  Camera.Nokia N900 has 5MP camera and in this area, Nokia N8 stays way ahead with 12MP camera and xenon flash.Nokia N8 has xenon flash, which normal cameras use, still even normal cameras cannot take good pictures in dim night lighting.'),(3587,11,270,'Similarly N8 photos come good, if taken in close shots in night.'),(3589,13,270,'The beauty with N8 is its photo and video editing softwares out of the box, which are really good.HD video recording in N8 is good, provided you don\'t show quick movements to turn the camera to a different angle and this is mainly due to the 25 frames per second video recording.Conclusion: Nokia N8 camera and its capabilities are one of the best.4)  GPS.Nokia N900 is pretty dumb in this area too, as it doesn\'t have voice guidance out of box.'),(3590,14,270,'So lets directly jump to Nokia N8.Nokia N8 has one of the best GPS with voice guidance, one major disadvantage that I came across is, it needs 3G connection to work(I am not sure whether this is correct, what I am quoting is just my experience).'),(3592,16,270,'I just found two minor issues, one is it informs you to take a turn just when you are few feet away to take the turn, whereas Garmin GPS informs you well ahead.'),(3593,17,270,'Similar way when you arrive at your destination, it says you arrived at destination, it does not say, whether your destination is on the right or left, whereas Garmin GPS tells which side your destination is going to be.Conclusion: Nokia N8 GPS is definitely good.5)  Widgets.Nokia N900 stands out with respect to widgets and its definitely the best in the industry.'),(3594,18,270,'You can place the widgets whereever you want, even one on top of the other.'),(3595,19,270,'Widgets are really useful in N900.Nokia N8 on the other hand has fixed dimensions for widgets and you can\'t place it whereever you like.'),(3597,21,270,'The main drawback for this that I found is, in email widget, you don\'t get much required information from the widget, you still need to jump into the mail app to know what email came to you now.'),(3598,22,270,'Still widgets look good in N8.Conclusion: Nokia N8 widgets are still good.6)  Chat and Voip.Nokia N900 stands out in this area too, as Skype worked with Nokia to have the skype integrated into the contacts.'),(3599,23,270,'Like that, google, yahoo, even sametime all are integrated into the contacts itself.'),(3600,24,270,'You just need to go to contacts to see who is online.'),(3601,25,270,'You can call that contact through various options, like gsm call or voip call using skype or skype to skype call or skype to skype video call, same way for google, yahoo etc.'),(3602,26,270,'It is very powerful, none of the mobile has it integrated like this.With respect to Nokia N8, I believe it is not out of box and I am not sure whether I need to install anything to get a similar experience.'),(3603,27,270,'I heard skype is still building an app for N8, so still I am searching for a provider who can offer video calling capabilities, so that I can use the secondary camera.Conclusion: Nokia N8\'s capabilities in this area are not yet explored.7)  Social networks.Nokia N900 has beautiful widgets and integration to contact well.Nokia N8 is not less to this.'),(3604,28,270,'It has widgets and integration to contact also well.Conclusion: Nokia N8\'s social network capabilities are good.8)  Bluetooth.Nokia N900 has the usual bluetooth version and it works good even with A2DP.Nokia N8 stands out in this, with latest bluetooth version 3.0.'),(3605,29,270,'The transfers are really fast compared to the older version.'),(3606,30,270,'The beauty comes with out of box drivers to support bluetooth devices like mouse, keyboard etc.'),(3607,31,270,'Imagine, I paired my bluetooth keyboard and mouse to the phone and it reduced the time that I spent to do the typing, a lot.'),(3608,32,270,'I don\'t have a monitor to connect using the HDMI port, if I have, then it becomes a complete system.Conclusion: This is one of the best in Nokia N8.9)  Battery life.Nokia N900, in line with all the other powerful smartphones, with all the widgets constantly checking the internet and all the chat softwares too constantly checking internet, it comes for 75% of the day and you need to charge it after that.Nokia N8, to my surprise even with all the above said things, it is able to withstand for atleast 2 days.Conclusion: Battery is really good in N8.10)  WebTV.Nokia N900 doesn\'t have this capability.Nokia N8: need to explore in this area.Conclusion: Need to explore in this area.11)  Micro USB capabilities.Nokia N900, not much to say.Nokia N8, can read your memory stick out of the box and will show it as a drive in the file manager.Conclusion: Micro USB in Nokia N8 is capable of more things.12)  Speakers.Nokia N900, has stereo speakers and it can produce loud sounds without any external speakers.Nokia N8, doesn\'t have stereo speakers, but to my surprise the sound is equally loud as N900, but I found only one problem in this area, as the speaker is in the camera compartment which directly comes in contact to the ground.'),(3609,33,270,'If you keep the phone down on a desk, you will not be able to hear any sound, as the speaker is blocked by the desk.'),(3610,34,270,'Similarly even the mic is on the same side, so if you talk over phone handsfree, by keeping the phone on the desk, both the parties are not going to hear properly.13)  FM transmitter and internet radio.Nokia N900 is outstanding in this area.'),(3611,35,270,'If you find to get your popular radio stations URL from internet, you just need to grab the URL and give it to the media player, then N900 can stream your radio station live from internet either using wifi or 3G, which means even if you are in any part of the world, you will be able to hear your favourite radio station live.'),(3612,36,270,'Using the build-in FM transmitter, you can transmit to your own car radio.Nokia N8 has the FM transmitter, which is equally good to N900.'),(3613,37,270,'Even though N8 has internet radio concept, it is basically app based, which means whatever stations the app is providing, thats what you are going to hear.'),(3614,38,270,'If you want to do the same things as above(like grabbing an url and feeding it to media player), I am not sure how to do it.Conclusion: FM transmitter is really good, but internet radio needs some improvement.I hope, I covered the review of some distinct features apart from the usual ones.'),(3615,0,271,'Bought phone to replace N97 which is giving me RAM memory problems.'),(3616,1,271,'After long doubting wether to go with N8 or iPhone, finally choose for N8 although a little worried about the turning off issue.During set up phone turned off and impossible to turn on again, neither get it into battery charging mode.'),(3617,2,271,'Very disappointed.Update 19.12.2010 -  Amazon sent me to Nokia and to come back to them if encountering any problems with Nokia.'),(3618,4,271,'Maybe assistance on working days only, so maybe tomorrow?Found on internet additional hard reset besides maintaining power key for 8 seconds: Press menu - camera - volume down keys together.'),(3619,5,271,'Than try again power key for 8 seconds until phone vibrates.'),(3621,7,271,'It died several more times, but could get it alive this way again.'),(3622,8,271,'After several days it seems stable now.As a comment found on internet: it is like buying a new BMW/Mercedes having to ask road assistance to start it!'),(3623,9,271,'!Update 24.12.2010 - After 4 days it died again being able to start it up again after waiting a few hours doing the same tricks again.'),(3625,11,271,'Decided to turn it in to go for another brand/model.'),(3626,12,271,'Amazon customer service has been helpfull, Nokia Care by e-mail is useless, they don\'t answer.Update 05.01.2011 - Thumb up for Amazon customer service, professional and on time.'),(3627,13,271,'Nokia Care responded after 9 days, allready returned the phone, sending a standard message that the phone needed a technician and repairs (!!'),(3629,15,271,'Shame Nokia with this very very poor respond to this global problem (see Nokia internet forums).Update 27.05.2011 - After 5 months Nokia responds to my email indicating that I have to go to another Internet site and send in again my claim!!!'),(3631,0,272,'Nokia for me always represented Built like a tank quality levels.'),(3632,1,272,'This product general built is also very good quality, better than the crappies blackberries, huawei and motorolla, it does is.'),(3633,2,272,'Camera quality it\'s the best of the best, very very clear pictures, but no so good in rooms with poor ligth.'),(3634,3,272,'Adding memory you will have lot of space to record pics and videos.'),(3635,4,272,'Some cons are the battery, it doesnt long more than 1 day, it\'s annoying having to charge it almost every day, it seems consuming too much power and doesnt like or know how to save it, software and functions get choppy when battery is dying.'),(3636,5,272,'Software is too complex and confusing, i really hate this part, even considering switch to a less &#34;advanced&#34; phone with a simple software like Nokia E72 wich i owned, Applications and functions depend on internet speed, mine is very bad and slow so i can\'t take advantage of this, except to watch my Email\'s accounts, sending sms it\'s easy for the dictionary and size of the virtual keyboard, but responsiveness of screen vary acording to power stock, which is always dying whenever i need the phone, lol.'),(3637,6,272,'Graphical power is good, games play as old NES and Music Videos look really really amazing, terrific colours, sound it\'s loud but mediocre.'),(3638,7,272,'Web browsing is fast for me as much as i use the wifi.As corollary, regardin to battery life i think buying a brand new battery should fix the issue, and about connectivity well, i cant blame the cellular since my Telecomunications provider is the real guitly for its bad and unestable service.'),(3639,8,272,'The software it is too complex and you gotta be patience to understand it.'),(3640,9,272,'I give 4 starts since i just like it but dont love it.Would i recommend it?'),(3641,0,273,'about my order:1) I had 1 day delivery, however it took 2 days on the way for delivery, I had it in the late afternoon on the second day before I decide return it.'),(3642,1,273,'remember the carrier is UPS, it was the only one delivery service provider for 2008 Olypic game, but seems it screwed domestic delivery up right now.'),(3643,2,273,'for me 1 day delivery means within 24 hours and I was only available on that day but the day after that day.'),(3644,3,273,'but this order takes 52 hours from I placed it.2) after I placed my N8 order 30 hours, the price was dropped $30 bucks to $399.Product pros:1) multiple language support, English, Spanish and other three popular languages.2) big and high resolution touch screen.3) it\'s a colorful device, and have 5 else alternatives4) 12MP cameraProduct cons:1) again, lack asian language support, such as Chinese.2) the firmware version(11.12) is lower in comparison with other regions(13.16).3) bettery life is not long enough to support the big fancy screen, nomally 20-30 hours for each recharging.4) inferior camera flash light will spoil the picture quaily, seems it\'s taken under heavy fog circumstance.5) never reset it to factory setup before your fully backup your N8, otherwish you won\'t install Ovi store and a few fancy apps anymore.'),(3645,4,273,'for normal users the only way to get them back is you have to go to NOKIA service support center to ask help from specialist, but me.6) Symbian^3 OS is not realy high performance and convenience compare to Android, new version Win7 mobile and iPhone.'),(3648,2,274,'There are vertical and horizantal lines on the screen.'),(3649,3,274,'the lines are very noticeable when I hold my phone horizantally (landscape mode).I did not waste my time trying to fix it and just opened my amazon account and requested replacement.Within 1 hour I got e-mail from customer

call.'),(3660,8,275,'Why this phone stood out to me is the extras you get.'),(3661,9,275,'And since I don\'t consider a tad over 400 gold grinkles cheap, those extras better make it worth while.'),(3664,12,275,'The camera on this phone is the best ever used on a cell phone.'),(3665,13,275,'What you will be doing without is the telephoto capabilities, but the camera takes great pictures

facebook, email and surf the net at home or in hot spots.It saves a lot of money because you do not have to lock in to an expensive phone plan if you are just looking for a replacement phone....I just used this to replace my old phone.However, what I don\'t like about the phone is that it isn\'t always user friendly, and if you are technically challenged like I am it can get a bit frustrating at times to figure out what you are doing.Luckily, if you go to the nokia site you will find a great discussion board where people can give you solutions about how to use this and that option or any problem that come up.The mannual that comes with the phone is useless.I have also called nokia customer service with some questions, and they have been helpful.I must warn that when it says \"US Version\", it really means that it is an international phone with an American adaptor.I didn\'t like this because I thought I was getting a US phone.The seller sent me free of charge an original nokia US charger, I am pleased that he offered to do that.But, the charger cord is a little short which can make it difficult to talk on while it is charging.Words like color are colour, favorite is favourite...so uses British English.That doesn\'t bother me so much, though.The apps aren\'t great, but I don\'t really use apps anyway.The numbers are hard to find, but all in all you get used to the quirks and realize that you have a lot for the money.The camera isn\'t bad, but the video is really short.Just not as users friendly as I thought it would be, but I would buy it again simply because of internet access, and the QWERTY key pad is easy to use.I love texting on this phone, but I had a problem with sending and receiving photos.Found out the phone has to be programmed, and you have to either call nokia or find an answer on the Nokia discussion board.Don\'t be afraid to buy...especially if you know a lot about cell phones or if you have someone who can help you figure it out.My

Symbian can have a different UI structure and user\'s experience may not very be consistent across different apps even though they are using the same device (N8).The less tight structure of Symbian APIs has proved to be a strength as Symbian has evolved to support a much larger variety of hardware types with different phone form factors:- some touch screen- some T9 keypad- some qwerty keypadNokia, as a leading phone manufacturer, offers a larger choice of phone form factors for a larger customer base...that\'s the reason Nokia is a leading phone manufacturer.Each form factor will be preferred by different types of users, since there is a much wider consumer base.Many business users will prefer a qwerty keyboard.Many users will prefer a T9 keypad and find the qwerty keyboard a distraction with too many buttons...for example, they usually do not do a lot of texting or type on a computer keyboard.Many people like the \"feel\" of a touch UI...but that also means that each app is more likely to have \"touch buttons\" on a different location of the screen.That means touch UI phones require the users to \"look before you touch\".That means with the keyboard or keypad, users
